    "summary": "Pacific Powers: Imperial Competition and Cooperation in Micronesia. As geopolitical competition and conflict in the Pacific region grows, this project seeks to uncover the complex historical origins of this situation. It will assess why Micronesia has been the site of competing projects of power projection and how the people of the region have responded to radically different imperial powers. Using hitherto untapped archival materials in six different languages, it investigates how and why Micronesia was targeted and then conquered by the Spanish, the Germans, the Japanese and the United States before winning independence. In doing so, it seeks to offer a deeper understanding of our region, explaining why imperial competition in the Pacific has been the historical norm rather than the exception.     ",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Micronesia covers millions of square kilometres in the Pacific region north of Papua New Guinea. It is of immense economic, geostrategic and political importance to Australia. In his speech launching the National Defence Strategy in April 2024, Deputy PM Richard Marles stated “we have put the Pacific at the heart of our strategic policy where it belongs.' Before that, while visiting the Marshall Islands in 2022, Foreign Minister Penny Wong also said Australia had 'ignored the calls of our Pacific family' for too long. The importance of the Pacific was also confirmed in Australia's International Development Policy of 2023. \nFor Australia to engage meaningfully with its Pacific neighbours and be able to promote regional peace, it must understand the region's complicated past. This project aims to deepen our historical understanding by asking why large powers, including Spain, Germany, Japan and the United States, have sought to control Micronesia, how they shaped the region; and what the legacies of this history are for Pasifika peoples. It will do so through an in-depth examination of archival materials by a multilingual team of leading specialists. This project will communicate its findings to different stakeholders in both scholarly outputs, such as books and journal articles, and in public forums such as the media and public lectures in Micronesia itself. It will also train a new cohort of experts who understand the history of international relations in the Pacific region. ",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Despite Australia’s multicultural and linguistic diversity, learners continue to miss out on the known academic, cognitive, economic, psychological, and social benefits of multilingualism. Just 9% of year 12 students complete language studies, leading some to refer to Australia as a “graveyard for languages” stuck in a “monolingual mindset”.\n\nTo reverse this worrying trend, this project aims to unravel the mystery of language control in polyglots: people who master three or more languages. Innovative computational and experimental approaches will be used to simulate and predict polyglot strategies, followed by novel experiments to validate the model, resulting in a new theoretical and computational model of how multilinguals harness knowledge from languages by seamlessly controlling them.\n\nThe research team will disseminate findings to language advocacy and education policy stakeholders to influence implementation of language learning in all preschools and primary schools nationwide and expand it at high school level. These policy changes would turbocharge language learning in young Australians and align Australia with other countries.\n\nAdditionally, by driving improvements to existing technologies like Duolingo and automatic speech recognition, the project’s outcomes can facilitate more effective communication across multilingual boundaries in Australia and worldwide to confer the lifelong cognitive, health, social and lifestyle advantages inherent to multilingualism.",

The goal of this proposal is to understand how brown food webs involving the transfer of energy and nutrients from senescent vegetation to arthropod detritivores such as termites and their predators play an essential role in the functioning of arid ecosystems. The results will provide a whole of ecosystem understanding of how brown food webs sustain the function and biodiversity of arid ecosystems and how grazing can disrupt brown food webs and affect biodiversity.

    "summary": "Revealing Universal and Cultural Origins of Music-Induced Affect. Across almost all human cultures, music has a remarkable capacity to communicate different affects (emotions and feelings). However it is unknown which, if any, associations between music-acoustical features and affects are universal, and which are cultural. In a music cognition field-research program of unprecedented scope, we aim to estimate how tones in melodic, polyphonic, harmonic, and rhythmic contexts influence affective responses, and the extent to which these effects are mediated by cultural mechanisms (familiarity and association). The findings will have profound implications for the use of sound and music in therapeutic applications and will help identify ways to bridge cultural divides through intercultural musical appreciation.",

Australian children often use external thinking tools (e.g., calculators, laptops, smartphones) to help themselves solve problems. Among adults, such cognitive offloading behaviours can have detrimental effects on internal cognitive abilities, but nothing is known about the long-term effects on children. This project aims to examine how children and adolescents trade off the benefits and costs of cognitive offloading, and establish the cognitive and neurocognitive causes and consequences of such trade-offs. Expected outcomes include the ability to identify children whose use of cognitive offloading may put their thinking skills at risk.

We use these tools to take notes, set alarms, keep appointments, perform mathematical calculations, and navigate the streets.  The current generation of Australian children is the first to grow up with ubiquitous access to such cognitive offloading techniques, and yet nothing is known about how the tendency to offload information impacts children’s cognitive development. This project will examine, for the first time, the cognitive and neurocognitive causes and consequences of cognitive offloading decisions in children aged 8 to 15 years. We will determine the different strategies that children use when offloading, the key ages at which these strategies emerge and change, and whether such strategies are associated with long-term positive or negative effects. Findings will be shared with education professionals and policymakers to facilitate downstream social benefits to the community. Examples of these benefits include new assessment tools that can identify children at risk of crystallising maladaptive offloading tendencies. The project will thereby lay the foundation for teaching Australian children to better use cognitive offloading to their advantage without limiting the development of their cognitive capacities.",

We use this ability – termed analogical reasoning – every day, for example, you read a map by mentally aligning the image on your phone with real-life landmarks and streets as you navigate. Since analogical reasoning is the vital foundation for effective learning, particularly in mathematics and science, clarifying how analogical abilities emerge and develop is key to understanding why some children learn more readily than others. This project brings a new, interdisciplinary approach to understanding analogical abilities in early childhood, which will generate new knowledge about nascent abilities in preverbal infants, clarify how language supports this emerging capacity in preschoolers, and reveal how neural markers of analogy change across the lifespan. These findings are poised to advance our understanding of fundamental learning processes that make human cognition unique. Research outcomes will empower parents and educators with evidence-based insights about how children develop and how best to support their learning in this critical period (Priority Focus Area #2, The Early Years Strategy 2024-2034). This benefits Australia by helping to support positive outcomes across children’s future health, wellbeing, educational achievement and productivity.",

    "summary": "Scope and ramifications of Indigenous language loss among PNG's youth. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is Australia’s closest neighbour, biggest recipient of Australian Aid, and a key strategic partner. Yet some Papua New Guineans think that Australia is falling behind East Asian nations in grasping PNG’s current needs. A massive societal change is underway in PNG, through which its youth appear to be rapidly abandoning its 600-800 Indigenous languages. This could have major ramifications for social cohesion in a country where language has traditionally been a major marker of group identity. We will assess the scope of Indigenous language loss among youth in PNG, assess the potential for intervention, and study ramifications for social cohesion, individual and community well-being, and even cognition.",

As Australia’s nearest neighbour, primary aid recipient, and strategic partner, PNG’s 600-800 Indigenous languages are key to group identity, and a factor in social stability. However, the actual extent of Indigenous language loss in PNG is unknown.\n\nOur project aims to determine the extent of PNG Indigenous language loss and whether wellbeing and prosocial behaviour can be positively linked to maintaining and revitalising Indigenous language skills in PNG communities.\n\nThis research will enable PNG communities to make informed decisions about maintaining, abandoning, or revitalizing their Indigenous languages. This may provide sociocultural and health benefits. It will also enhance our understanding of the cultures of our nearest neighbour, and enable more efficient aid funding—especially in remote parts of PNG.\n \nResearch outcomes will be promoted through an international linguistics meeting in PNG, as well as through the PNG communities themselves. The project includes the development of Indigenous language revitalisation and strengthening programs which will be implemented in PNG, but can also be adapted to address Indigenous language loss in other countries, including Australia.\n",

CO2 electrolysis enables production of renewable fuels and chemicals from Earth-abundant sources of CO2 and water, but the thermal management poses a challenge in scaling up the process. This project expects to generate new knowledge in electrocatalysis using in-situ characterisation and theoretical modelling. Expected outcomes include innovative cooling strategies and designs for large-scale CO2 electrolysers, which will significantly benefit carbon emissions reduction in Australia.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) electrolysers offer a promising solution for recycling CO2 and storing renewable electricity from solar and wind. Powered by electrical energy, CO2 electrolysers produce fuels and chemicals that are in high demand across industries—a market valued at over $300 billion, including everyday materials such as plastics and Lycra. By storing and transporting energy through chemical bonds, we can safely and efficiently harness intermittent renewable energy for both domestic use and export. However, a significant challenge in scaling up CO2 electrolysers is the excessive heat they generate, which can compromise stability of materials, quality of products, and overall efficiency of electrolyser components. Presently, over 50% of the energy input is lost as heat. This project seeks to address this issue by employing novel methods to monitor heat production and developing advanced heat mitigation strategies specifically for large-scale CO2 electrolysers. The project is expected to generate patentable technologies that will be leveraged by Australia’s leading renewable energy sectors, facilitating the adoption of this sustainable technology. The project will enhance public awareness of net-zero goals through the dissemination of research findings via media channels and social media platforms. The project is poised to play a pivotal role in Australia’s journey towards a global leader in reducing carbon emissions and in generating and exporting sustainable energy.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "To achieve Australia’s net zero future and support the widespread adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy resources, better high-energy battery storage is urgently needed. While lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been instrumental, they rely on unsafe flammable liquid electrolytes and only store limited amounts of energy. A promising alternative are lithium metal batteries, which could double the storage capacity of conventional LIBs. To deliver on this promise, new solid electrolytes, especially those made of polymer, must be developed to address both safety and efficiency concerns in lithium metal batteries. Current solid polymer electrolytes are difficult to produce and do not possess the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties needed for widespread adoption. This project aims to overcome these challenges by developing rapid, one-step 3D-printing techniques to create safe and efficient solid polymer electrolytes specifically designed for high-energy lithium metal batteries. The project aligns with the Australian Government’s focus on energy and advanced manufacturing. By leveraging Australia’s abundant lithium reserves, the project not only promises substantial economic benefits but also advances local lithium battery production technology. Project outcomes will be commercialised, contributing to the growth of Australia’s battery and manufacturing sectors and advancing the country’s clean energy future.",

    "summary": "Targeting the circadian clock to improve grain quality in wheat. This project aims to establish a novel approach to improve protein content of wheat grain without loss of yield in Australian conditions. The project expects to build a mechanistic understanding of how the circadian clock, which controls daily and seasonal rhythms, adjusts the timing of leaf senescence and affects grain nutrient content in wheat. Expected outcomes include an expanded view of the extent and influence of circadian clock variation within Australian wheat cultivars and deeper functional knowledge of circadian clocks in a cereal crop. This would provide significant benefits for breeders, growers and consumers because protein content determines the economic value of grain and end-use characteristics of flour.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Wheat is Australia’s most productive crop, representing more than 10% of total agricultural production and worth ~$15 billion/year. The protein content of grain is an important trait because it affects the baking properties of flour and therefore the value of the grain. A long-standing challenge is that increased grain protein content is typically associated with loss of yield. This is controlled by the timing of key developmental stages in wheat growth and influenced by environmental conditions.  This project aims to develop a new approach to improve grain quality of wheat grown in Australian environments by identifying genetic components and mechanisms that control the timing of growing processes.\nIncreasing protein content of wheat grain by as little as 0.5% can add up to 20% to the value of the crop. Therefore, successful outcomes from this project could contribute to the sizeable agricultural economy, benefiting growers and consumers.\nResearch outcomes from this project could be used by those within the agricultural and biotechnology industries via reports to inform growers of their local growing conditions and provide breeders a knowledgeable assessment of Australian conditions.\n",

The project involves collaboration with teachers from primary and secondary schools (state and private), and with technology industry partners across urban, regional and rural Australian contexts to equip students to use AI-XR texts as active agents to critically reflect on underlying biases, values and interests. Outcomes include evidence-based models and exemplars for teaching students to be confident users of AI and extended reality technologies for multimodal reading and authoring, and state-of-the-art skillsets that are now needed by all young Australians to sustain digital and workforce participation for Australian education—the engine room of Australia's future economy.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australians increasingly venture overseas for work or study during their youth. This international movement of young Australians is part of a global trend for young people. Indeed, Australia is also a destination for similarly mobile youth from abroad – many of whom pay to study at Australian universities or come for a working holiday. Although quite a lot is known about what drives youth to be mobile, we know little of what happens in the longer term as they enter a new life stage and face decisions about returning and settling down. This study will address this gap in knowledge by tracking the experiences and intentions of a group of 800 mobile youth through surveys, network maps and interviews conducted over a decade as they travel and transition into adulthood. By understanding the longer term drivers of mobility and enablers of settlement, governments and businesses will be better able to design programs and policies to help Australian society benefit from youth mobility. These include Australians reintegrating with knowledge, skills, entrepreneurial capacities, industry networks and new cultural experiences and ideas, but also retaining migrant youth, many trained with desired skills in our university system. Research outcomes will be disseminated to the project advisory board, government and industry stakeholders through workshops, a data dashboard and policy papers. This engagement will promote translation of the research into programs and policies.",

Yet the expansion of this industry may face a difficulty because common mechanical fluid manipulation approaches are not suitable for applications such as in pharmaceutics due to the need of handling accurately very small fluid volumes or because of the presence of chemically aggressive media.  This project aims to develop a versatile framework for easy-to-control non-intrusive electromagnetic (EM) fluid flow forcing methods for use in micromixing, micropumping and targeted chemical delivery.  This study will generate a better understanding of how EM driven film and shallow layer flows behave in various geometric configurations and how they are influenced by different wall conditions. It will suggest novel ways of optimising the operation of existing microfluidic devices and build a prototype experimental apparatus capable of inducing complex EM-driven flows.  Research outcomes will pioneer new technological principles for developing next-generation applications benefiting the Australian microfluidic industry and its end-users. To promote our study beyond academia and to explore the opportunity of commercialisation, we will engage with CSIRO and Australian National Science Agency with the partnership proposal in their research production initiative under the microfluidics scheme.",

The electric field helps us see the shape, while the magnetic field reveals which particles are causing the rotation. On a broader scale, this research tackles important questions in quantum mechanics, which is fundamental to chemistry, biology, and various technologies. The project also seeks to enhance international scientific collaboration by developing new techniques at Australia's Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility and using them at top laboratories worldwide. Moreover, the project will benefit society by offering hands-on training in advanced nuclear methods. This training will produce skilled professionals capable of addressing issues related to nuclear technologies, safety, and regulation.

Together, these two climate systems affect over 2.2 billion people internationally and impact major economic activities across regions of high social and cultural significance. This project will provide foundational environmental data covering periods of dramatic transformation during the first peopling of Australia and extinction of megafauna over the last 65,000 years. By examining past periods of flooding and drought, the project evaluates if current and future conditions have occurred before, to provide indispensable reference data to future-proof landscape management efforts such as agricultural development, climate change mitigation and government adaptation strategies in desert Australia. This will provide economic and social benefit to desert communities and the farming and energy sectors operating in dryland regions, and will guide environmental management for ecosystems threatened by climate change.

This project aims to develop new ways to convert simple hydrocarbon feedstocks into value added fine chemicals, through the development of the strongest known organoiodine oxidizing agents. This project expects to result in the discovery of new high oxidation state iodine compounds that will be the most reactive in their class to date, which will provide a widely sought capability to directly convert simple C-H bonds into more valuable C-X bonds, where X can be virtually any other element. The new capabilities that this project aims to develop may benefit Australian SME chemical manufacturers to better use Australia's abundant simple hydrocarbon resources and enhance the value of these molecules by 10- to more than 100-fold.",

For this industry to progress forward to developing more renewable products with less reliance on fossil fuels, invention of new techniques is needed. Natural gas and wood, both of which Australia has an abundance, are renewable materials that can act to fuel machines and industrial processes. However, at the moment, these materials are not used frequently in the Australian chemical industry. This project will develop new chemical agents and methods to convert these simple and cheap natural materials, worth cents per kilogram, into high-value fine chemicals worth more than $10 per kilogram, a value addition of multiple orders of magnitude. The results of this project will be of particular interest to many small-medium enterprises within the chemical industry in Australia and will be highly economical to produce and sell to an internal market thus benefiting the Australian economy. To maximise future translation, results from the project will be communicated through the project teams established networks in the Australian fine chemical production sector and CSIRO, as well as through social media channels and mainstream media to extend sector reach.\n\n ",

We aim to show that income inequality measured by income shares is currently mis-measured due to omission of several important sources of capital income, such as depreciation allowances, imputed rent, and capital gains. To address this, the project aims to develop an analytical framework equipped to construct corrected measures of income shares that include the omitted capital income and cover a much longer period than previous inequality measures for Australia, the US, UK, Germany, and Scandinavia. We expect that inequality has followed a trajectory that is quite different from conventional measures of the functional income distribution. This has implications for several strands of macroeconomic analysis and economic policy.\n",

Furthermore, implicit rental income on housing is markedly underestimated because capital gains on real estate is omitted and, therefore, theory inconsistent. \n\n\nThe project has several implications for policy: 1) The generated productivity data will show whether wages have been growing too fast or too slow; 2) the inflationary impact of income shares can be assessed; 3) the productivity advances in Australia can be better accessed than with previous data; and 4) a much improved measure of income inequality will give insight into the evolution of income shares.\n\n\n\n",

However, H2 can also originate from a range of geological processes, and 'natural' H2 is attracting wide interest because of its potential to provide a clean energy source that can be produced from geological formations at low cost. Exploration for commercial-scale natural H2 is at an early stage, and whilst promising discoveries have been made recently in South Australia’s Yorke Peninsula, the geological mechanisms behind the formation and accumulation of natural H2 are poorly understood. This project will combine innovative underground image processing with state-of-the-art laboratory techniques, to identify the key factors that drive the generation, movement and preservation of natural H2 in Earth’s crust. Our work will result in a world-first exploration framework that is needed to determine the technical and commercial viability of large-scale production of natural H2. The research will position Australia as a global leader in the strategic technological shift to net-zero emissions, providing economic and environmental benefits to Australians. Our findings will be promoted to the Australian energy industry for adoption through a program of workshops and training, and to the Australian public through a dedicated website where research outcomes will be summarised in plain language briefs.",

    "summary": "Improving wheat nutrient use via the plant nitrogen–potassium–water nexus. To optimise growth and yield, plants must maintain careful balances of water and ions in their cells. While individual nitrogen, potassium, and water transporters that uptake nutrients from soil are mostly known, how these systems are co-ordinated is not, especially in important cereal crops such as wheat. This project aims to uncover new molecular mechanisms that co-regulate water and ion uptake in wheat. Results are expected to provide significant benefits to farmers by creating new options for improved nutrient use efficiency in economically relevant plants; reducing the need for, and impact of, costly fertilisers; and improving the long-term environmental sustainability of Australian agriculture.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Modern agriculture heavily relies on the use of fertilisers to enhance crop yields. The efficiency of fertiliser use is closely tied to water, which transports essential nutrients to the roots, leaves, and grains of plants. However, less than one-third of applied fertilisers are absorbed by crops, with the remainder contributing to air and water pollution and the release of greenhouse gases. Focusing on the widely used nutrients nitrogen and potassium, our research aims to enhance nutrient use efficiency in wheat—a crop projected to contribute $10.4 billion to the Australian economy in 2024/25. We will investigate the coordination of water and nutrient uptake from soil into wheat roots using an innovative approach involving light-activated proteins. Our discoveries are expected to optimise fertiliser and water use, providing critical insights for developing wheat varieties with superior nutrient and water absorption capabilities. These advancements will offer significant benefits to farmers by reducing the need for costly fertilisers and mitigating their environmental impact. The findings will be disseminated to the industry through the Australian Plant Breeding Academy, which will aid in developing new wheat varieties and training the next generation of plant scientists to ensure the industry's continued success. Additionally, the Waite Research Institute's established connections with the wheat industry will be leveraged to maximise the impact of our results. ",

In doing so, this project will generate knowledge and techniques that are relevant to a wide range of biological and environmental applications. These insights will provide significant economic and environmental benefits to Australia. Greater understanding of cell biology will reduce unnecessary experimentation, and its associated time and financial costs. Understanding the susceptibility of whale populations to human-driven change will assist with environmental decision-making, safeguard Australia’s valuable whale-watching industry and help protect whales from human actions.

This project aims to deepen our understanding of the history of physical anthropology, comparative anatomy and population genetics over the twentieth century. It will do so through analysing ‘dermatoglyphics’, the study of ridges, lines, and shape of the human (and other primate) hand. Still occasionally pursued to study human variation, as well as medical diagnostics, the project will be the first historical study of this little-understood aspect of ‘race science’, and of its legacy, including its Australian applications. This research should improve our capacity to assess the ethical dimensions of current human, medical and life sciences.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "We all make poor decisions some of the time. However, some people make poor decisions a lot of the time. Across a variety of domains, from health to the environment, the impacts of poor decisions by individuals are staggering. For example, excessive alcohol use costs the economy $67bn/year. Tobacco use, lack of physical activity and poor dietary choices cost $27bn/year. Australians lead the world for gambling-related losses ($21bn/year). There is a pressing need to understand how we learn from our mistakes to mitigate these impacts on individuals and the community. Yet we know very little about the psychological and brain mechanisms that help us learn from our mistakes.  This Discovery project addresses this need by generating a transformative, new understanding of the cognitive processes and brain mechanisms supporting learning from our mistakes and driving better versus worse decisions at the level of the individual. It uses innovative behavioural, cellular, and molecular genetic tools to map how we learn from our mistakes to make better decisions in the future. With a clear established pathway from innovation to impact on real world settings, this Discovery expects to deliver new technology, new knowledge, and new capacity to address the mechanisms of better decisions and mitigate the individual, social and economic impacts of worse decisions.

While the current focus on critical minerals centres mainly on the exploitation of stand-alone resources, several precious and critical metals also occur as minor and/or trace elements in common copper sulphides within Australia’s existing mining-processing operations. To capitalise on the opportunities presented by recovery of all commodities of value within a processing chain, new predictive tools are required to understand trace element solubility, distribution, and release from copper sulphides. Our project will deliver breakthrough approaches to applied mineralogy, improved knowledge of local resource endowment, and insights to drive leaner processing and less waste. The project thus contributes to Australia's critical mineral strategy and provides competitive advantage and long-term economic and environmental benefit to the wider community. Outcomes will be promoted to the broader public in popular and social media showing how Australia can optimise utilisation of its huge resources. This research will assist the nation in achieving its ambition to be a global leader in critical and precious minerals production and innovation and demonstrate how knowledge-based responsible and sustainable mining contributes to the green energy transition.",

This project aims to address long-standing questions regarding phase transitions in two-dimensional (2D) systems, impacting the development of advanced materials and electronics. It will use the team’s recently invented vortex-matter simulator of 2D charge systems to precisely study phase transitions in a configurable, defect free system. The expected outcomes of this project will be to determine the hierarchy of defect-seeded melting of a 2D crystal. Outcomes will provide enhanced understanding of 2D systems and establishment of new international collaborations in experimental quantum physics, benefitting the development of advanced electronics and manufacturing, and enhancing Australia’s reputation on the international stage.",

However, unlocking these advances requires new knowledge about material properties, including how materials change from one physical phase to the other. This project will study the solid to liquid melting transition in a two-dimensional material. Despite the everyday familiarity of the melting phase transition, there is controversy about how certain materials undergo this transition, and whether there is an intermediate phase between the solid and liquid phases. We will use a highly controllable quantum simulator to directly address the existence (or non-existence) of intermediate phases in a model system that consists of long-range interacting particles. This system is closely related to colloidal suspensions and liquid crystals.\n\nWe anticipate that improved understanding of the phases in our model system will impact the development of novel materials such as self-assembling films and nanostructured materials, among other potential outcomes. This work will also strengthen Australia’s world-leading effort in building a quantum industry, which is a key development area in the Australian government's Blueprint and Action Plan for Critical Technologies. This will provide economic, social and commercial benefits for Australia through providing pathways to new jobs, technology exports, and economic diversification.",

This will reveal previously unknown mechanisms of programmed cell death and how this shapes the body’s immune response. Such fundamental knowledge of how cell death occurs, and how cell death instructs immunity, may be harnessed in future assay design and drug development programs to generate new commercial products, such as research tools, diagnostics and immune-modulatory drugs. The project team is skilled at discovering new pathways of immune regulation and using this knowledge to develop new commercial products, and routinely works with Australia's biotechnology sector.

Our limited understanding of glassy (disordered) metallic nanoparticles is impeding the development of next-generation materials for biotechnology and clean energy. This project aims to use theory to guide fabrication of a new range of metal 'nanoglasses’. This is significant, because the properties of disordered materials can be vastly different from their crystalline counterparts, exhibiting enhanced plasticity, heat capacity, and chemical reactivity. Expected outcomes include a model for predicting the optical properties of nanoglasses and novel syntheses of gold-based nanoglasses, whose properties can be optimised at will.

This would make them ideal for new applications, such as in biotech, and lead to increased health benefits for Australians. This project will also seek to discover nanoglasses that can use energy from sunlight to speed up chemical reactions. Such particles could be used to permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, creating an environmental benefit to Australians through its use in combating climate change.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Estrogen is a hormone that plays a vital role in the reproductive, brain and bone health of all Australians. However, outdated ideas about sex and gender hinder scientific, medical and lay understandings of estrogen. This has led to divisive medical and public debate about the safety and effectiveness of estrogen therapies particularly for menopausal and trans and gender diverse people. This is a problem: without clear medical guidance, consumers turn to social media for health advice and take estrogens without medical supervision. To address this problem, this project examines how biases and cultural beliefs about sex and gender shape estrogen related scientific research, medical practices, public debate and lay practices. This first ever study of this issue analyses cutting-edge scientific research, medical practice and diverse people’s lived experiences to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of estrogen use. The project will contribute new knowledge with and for diverse stakeholders through a collaboratively curated series of public events and publications for policy makers, community organisations and professional bodies. Together, these will broaden and rebalance the debate about estrogen use in Australia and internationally. The use of our findings in practice will improve doctor/patient communication and inform decision-making thereby enhancing the health and wellbeing of menopausal and trans and gender diverse people in Australia.",

Half of this money goes towards data collection and research. Clearly, ecologists and managers widely agree that new information is critical for improving decisions. However, surprisingly, the application of mathematics to ecological management regularly suggests we spend too much on research. This wide disagreement between mathematical theory and ecological expertise forms a long-standing paradox in mathematical ecology. The project aims to resolve this paradox by deriving new theory for quantifying the value of information across systems and solving new problems that violate traditional mathematical assumptions in fisheries, outbreak management, and conservation.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Today, Australia spends less on the environment than 20 years ago. With inadequate resources to reverse the environment's downward trajectory, now more than ever, it is essential that we spend what we have effectively. Currently, half of environmental management budgets go towards collecting new information rather than deploying actions that can directly improve environmental outcomes. While new knowledge can improve management indirectly, it is unclear how much time, effort, and money we should spend to acquire it. Furthermore, if we invest heavily in obtaining new information, should most of this information be discovered through analysing existing data, or should we invest more heavily in acquiring new data? This project aims to develop new mathematical methodologies to better allocate resources between mathematical and statistical modelling, data acquisition, and deploying actions to achieve the best environmental outcomes. Expected benefits include (1) more secure food sources by improving Australian fishery assessment prioritisation, (2) increased biodiversity by designing more effective protected areas, and (3) reduced environmental, economic and societal risk through new guidelines for rapid mathematical modelling to inform policy during crises. We will work directly with Fisheries Queensland, discuss the work with other management agencies, and promote the results through social media and news outlets to maximise understanding and adoption of the new findings.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "There is a pressing need for Australia to promote clean energy generation for the transition to net zero. The proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are a promising clean energy technology for vehicle applications and portable energy devices, because of their high power density and ultra-low emission features. However, current PEMFCs face limitations in durability and high cost, hindering their practical application. As the core component in PEMFCs, the mainstream polymeric proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) are not only expensive but also suffer from physical degradation under high temperatures, leading to efficiency losses.\n\nThis project aims to address this critical research gap by developing novel metal-organic framework (MOF) crystal-glass PEMs with high performance, high durability and low cost, contributing to the widespread adoption of PEMFCs. This will benefit Australia economically and environmentally, by stimulating growth in Australia's renewable energy sector and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We will work with Australian industry partners to commercialise the developed membranes after the successful completion of this project. The fundamental knowledge developed from this project will also contribute to keeping Australia at the frontier position in PEMs, MOFs and fuel cells. The techniques developed in this research will also be readily extended to a variety of membrane applications, including gas separation, sensors and heterogeneous catalysts.",

This project will generate new molecular tools that allow RNA to be modified and adapted in a precise and controlled manner through a pioneering combination of computational, synthetic, and experimental techniques. These tools will enable the manipulation of natural and synthetic RNA, allowing the study of fundamental biological processes and the creation of RNA for bioengineering and medical purposes, such as enhancing insulin production or generating safer vaccines tailored to the individual’s genetic makeup. Additionally, these tools may aid in the development of effective and environmentally safe animal vaccines and treatments against pathogens for animals and plants of natural and economic importance in Australia. These tools could be commercialised or licensed to biotech and pharma companies globally, integrated into therapy production pipelines, and used by researchers to further explore these biological processes and discover new therapies, ensuring significant economic and societal impacts and contributing to a growing biotechnology market in Australia and worldwide.",

The cathode expects to improve the density of active sites and resist degradation due to the cathode reaction environment. The key novelty is to modify the mixed conductive perovskite bulk with surface alkali metal melts that can transport ions and reactivate the surface. Expected outcomes include enhanced efficiency of power generation and new techniques to develop high-performance catalyst materials, which are essential for energy conversion and thermal catalysis. This will benefit Australia’s environment and energy sector in managing carbon emissions and accelerate Australia’s transition to a carbon-neutral economy.",

As electricity generation is Australia’s largest source of carbon emissions, efficient clean power generation is an important step for Australia’s transition to clean energy. However, capitalising on these advantages of PCFCs is challenging because of the lack of cathode materials that can maintain an efficient and stable catalytic activity. \nThis project aims to develop a novel cathode for PCFCs with high activity and high stability, thus greatly promoting the widespread utilization of this promising clean technology and contributing to Australia’s transition to net zero. The knowledge generated through this project will also keep Australia in the frontier areas in novel perovskite materials, ceramic fuel cells and clean energy. The developed high performance perovskite cathode materials will potentially be commercialized through Uniquest at the University of Queensland following the successful completion of this project, benefiting the energy and manufacturing industries in Australia. The fundamental understanding and methodology from this project will also significantly contribute to many new applications of the novel perovskite materials such as membrane reactor for hydrogen production, CO2 electrolysis and solid oxide batteries etc. \n\n",

It’s not known why plants cannot grow and defend against pathogens simultaneously, and here, we hope to expose some of the mechanisms by adjusting growth conditions and analysing their effects on plant performance. If successful, the research will help breed better crops by identifying new stable sources of disease resistance and understanding how plant growth and disease resistance interact. The outcomes of this research will allow better, more environmentally friendly methods for controlling crop disease, helping farmers, consumers and exporters to enjoy the benefits of higher crop productivity, ultimately strengthening Australia’s economy and supporting local agricultural communities. The research results will be shared with breeding companies, agricultural researchers, and other stakeholders through planned meetings. The results will be published in scientific journals and industry news sources.",

As this claim about consciousness has become increasingly disputed, the idea has arisen that what makes humans unique is that they can mentally time travel. This project seeks to better understand mental time travel by investigating how this ability develops from childhood to adulthood, and whether it can be found in our closest non-human relatives, chimpanzees. This project will connect Australian research and policy development with a bourgeoning international movement that aims to better understand whether non-human animals have long-term interests that we should be considered when making decisions about their treatment. It will inform critical national debates about how we treat non-human animal in farming, medical research, and as companion animals and well as illuminating the cognitive mechanisms that ground human agency. This will connect Australia to a broader research network, contribute to important national policy decisions regarding non-human animals, contribute to important social and community dialogue about the role of non-human animals in our society, and to a furthered understanding of the relationship between humans and other animals.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The project aims to develop fundamental sciences for wireless human-machine collaboration (wHMC) to enable harmonious interaction between humans and intelligent machines in the emerging Industry 5.0. wHMC requires the co-design of tightly integrated communication and cyber-human control systems. Currently, there is a lack of theoretical foundation and practical frameworks for seamlessly fusing automated machines and human control loops to create safe, scalable, and flexible wHMC systems with assured performance. This project will establish the research foundation for wHMC, unlocking its full potential as a transformative force in advanced manufacturing. It aligns with Australia's focus on advanced manufacturing and digital transformation. The developed wHMC technologies will drive significant benefits for Australia. Economically, wHMC systems will revolutionise the manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture sectors by reducing operational costs and enhancing efficiency. This is particularly crucial for Australia, which has high labour costs and stringent safety standards. Socially, wHMC will improve workplace safety and foster innovation and collaboration, contributing to overall social well-being. Environmentally, the enhanced efficiency and automation in various sectors will lead to more sustainable practices. Proof-of-concept experiments for wHMC will be developed to promote understanding and demonstrate its potential to tackle intricate manufacturing challenges.",

This project adopts a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the exercise of the power of the Chinese state in epidemic control to pursue global and domestic outcomes over the past century. It will significantly advance historical and contemporary knowledge of how China responds to pandemics and their resulting public health emergencies. This project's social and cultural benefits are intended to improve understanding of China’s potential responses to future pandemics, which will be of benefit to Australian (and international) scholars and health policymakers. This study will also help the wider public understand the geopolitical impact of pandemics and a new surveillance culture facilitated by AI and digital surveillance technologies. Results will be shared with the Australian public through the creation of a new database on the history of epidemic control, published media commentaries, and a project website.",

This program has contributed to the understanding of exposure trends in the Australian population for legacy and emerging environmental pollutants. However, important knowledge gaps associated with this approach include unknown representativeness of pathology samples (for general population exposure) and the distribution of underlying individual data (to determine population reference values and define pooling strategies). In this project we address these knowledge gaps by comparing our HBM program using pooled pathology samples with specimens from a representative sample of the Australian population collected for the National Health Measurement Survey, which will be made available for researchers for the first time in 2024.\nThis project will validate and further inform methodology for HBM using pooled pathology samples to assess exposure to environmental pollutants, improving our understanding of exposure trends and potential risks to humans and the environment, and, thus, providing economic, social and environmental benefits for Australia.\nOngoing collaborations with state/territory and federal regulatory organisations will facilitate communication of findings and inform HBM research and methods, environmental policy, and chemical regulation. \n",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Robots continue to transform many areas of the Australian economy, particularly the manufacturing and resources commercial sectors. However, in areas of society that require complex physical contact between people and robots, such as social, cultural, health and assistive settings, there are challenges to the integration and uptake of robots due to the trust, safety and comfort of human-robot collaborations. Leveraging the unique and innovative platform of dance to investigate the embodied nature of physical interactions, this project aims to develop a critical understanding of how people and robots can move fluently together even through complex physical interactions. We will use machine learning to develop new ways for a person and robot to smoothly move together and have complex physical interactions including contact and support. These are crucial abilities for robots supporting people in social, cultural and assistive settings and will have important benefits to support increased robotic uptake in these areas. The new interaction methods will generate dance performances for a human and robot that can be shown in theatres and galleries, showcasing new ways for people and robots to move together. Providing a reliable and effective framework for better collaborative movement between people and robots will increase safety, trust and comfort for people, and better physical adaptability for robots, placing the Australian robotics sector at the forefront of robotic innovation.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The human brain has a finite processing capacity. Mechanisms of attention allow us to focus our limited cognitive resources on sensory inputs and actions that are relevant for guiding behaviour. The ability to sustain attention for prolonged periods is crucial for many real-world activities, from classroom learning and driving to specialist occupations in medicine, defence and aviation. It is well established, however, that people’s ability to sustain their attention begins to lapse after just a few minutes. Such lapses are major contributors to a range of catastrophic failures in the real world, including aircraft accidents and errors in medical procedures. The project aims to characterise the brain mechanisms responsible for regulating sustained attention, and to identify patterns of brain activity that herald impending lapses. Previous attempts to train people to improve their attention using behavioural feedback have had limited success. We have developed a novel machine-learning algorithm that decodes brain activity and predicts attention failures before they occur. We will use this real-time neurofeedback protocol to train people’s attention in a way that generalises to a range of task scenarios. Our work will provide a foundation for selecting and training individuals whose jobs require prolonged attentional control. The project will also put Australia at the forefront of the growing neurotechnology sector, estimated to be worth more than $50 billion per year.",

Hybrid varieties have shown the potential to produce up to 40% higher and more stable yields, as seen in maize and canola. However, developing hybrid breeding systems requires identifying specific genes, a process that is currently very labor-intensive and therefore costly. This project aims to accelerate the identification and tracking of these genes by better understanding how the proteins they encode bind to their RNA targets. \nThe economic benefits of hybrid varieties tailored to the challenges of the Australian climate, particularly for key crops like wheat, barley, and sorghum—major staples contributing to Australian agricultural exports—are expected to be significant. Societal benefits will come from more sustainable yields, ensuring better food and market security in the future. High-yielding hybrid cultivars will reduce the need for deforestation or converting natural habitats into farmland, helping to protect the environment. Additionally, the new knowledge will extend the use of these genes as biotechnological tools in synthetic biology and medicine.\nThe project's aims and expected outcomes will be shared with the wider community through public engagement programs, industry showcases, and media outreach.

The aim of this project is to develop artificial cells that can programmably communicate. This strategy uses modular, responsive DNA nanostructures to form nanopores and channels in synthetic compartments. Controlling the mixing and transfer of cargo within these networked systems will harness knowledge in nanotechnology and self-assembly to generate nanoreactors for chemical transformations. Engineering the migration of molecules across membrane boundaries will offer benefits in biotechnology and nanochemistry – for the triggered release of cargo, data transmission, and chemical fractionation and computation.",

Directed communication between molecules and reaction pathways in each zone ensures that tasks are undertaken efficiency, but current technologies cannot replicate this level of programmable information transfer. To develop sensing, catalysis, and tissue engineering technologies inspired by cellular systems, we need to engineer information highways between artificial compartments.\n\nThis project uses DNA structures to create reversible gateways between synthetic compartments. The development of artificial cells that dynamically connect and communicate will lead to downstream economic and commercial benefits ranging from targeted delivery systems to highly sensitive environmental sensors, new chemical separations methods, and ways to improve catalysis. Benefits to the Australian biotechnology market will be pipelined through partnerships with Swann Genetics, Moderna, and the CSIRO.\n\nAustralia’s synthetic biology industry is expected to generate $27 billion in revenue and 44,000 jobs by 2040. This project’s focus on Australia’s Research Priorities (2023) of 'developing impactful emerging technologies' will ensure highly trained personal for the bionanotechnology industry, enabling an innovative economy. This project will bring social benefits for Australia by demonstrating the importance of strategic fundamental science to broad audiences, through public talks, online videos, and social medias.",

The precise assembly of peptides into defined architectures is paramount for protein functionality, with any errors in this assembly leading to severe diseases. Mass spectrometry, a leading tool for studying protein structures, operates in the gas phase. Tools that close the gap between peptide assemblies in their native state in water and in the gas phase are scarce. This project develops a conceptually unprecedented approach to study the assembly of peptides in both: water and gas phase. The CIs have recently shown that [2+2] photocycloadditions, key reactions of chemical synthesis, can be manipulated by peptide assembly. Exploiting this assembly sensitivity, photoreactions will be turned from a synthetic into a missing analytical tool.",

Understanding the nanoscale workings of the synapse, the site of neuronal communication, is a holy grail of neuroscience. Munc13-1 prepares synaptic vesicle (SV) for neurotransmitter release. This grant will investigate how Munc13-1 is (1) enriched at the synapse, (2) undergoes translocation and immobilisation at the interface between SVs and the plasma membrane. Using cutting-edge super-resolution techniques, we will test whether Munc13-1 first binds to the membrane, then hooks SVs, thereby contributing to their immobilisation and building a fusogenic interface.

    "summary": "Understanding cell polarity & organelle biogenesis in parasites of mammals. Single-celled parasites cause economically significant diseases in both humans and livestock. These parasites undergo a complex process to build the organelles that control their entry into host cells at their apical end, making the parasites hyper-polarised. Despite their importance, the proteins that control polarity establishment and apical organelle biogenesis are not known. This project will investigate two evolutionarily divergent parasites: Plasmodium, a mosquito-transmitted parasite that causes malaria, and Cryptosporidium, a gastrointestinal parasite. We will determine when, where and how these parasites establish their polarity and build their apical organelles, and whether these pathways are evolutionarily conserved.",

Collectively, apicomplexans cost the global economy >$25B each year in control measures and production loss, with Crypto being the leading cause of calf loss in Australia’s livestock industry. To cause infection, these parasites need to form a uniquely shaped and organised lifecycle stage that enters host cells. It is not known how these parasites orchestrate this cellular organisation or what proteins control it. In this project, we will apply world-leading imaging approaches to determine if key proteins-of-interest enable malaria parasites or Crypto to form their unique cellular organisations. Further, we will establish the 2nd facility in Australia for the genetic manipulation of Crypto; a significant new resource given the parasite’s major burden on our livestock industry. Discoveries arising from this project may underpin development of new control measures for parasite-specific ‘Achilles heels’, able to target apicomplexans of economic and health importance to Australia and its major trading partners. Our work will advance imaging technology and applications, initiate multiple avenues of biological discovery, and train emerging leaders to build national research capability. Project findings will be shared with the public via media releases, social media and presentations to the community and Industry (e.g. School outreach, SA Museum, Livestock Producer Forums). ",

With escalating concerns over chemical pesticide use and the emergence of resistance in pest populations, alternative insecticidal strategies are urgently needed. This new class of insecticidal proteins offers a promising natural solution that has the potential to reduce reliance on costly and environmentally harmful chemical pesticides. By elucidating the molecular details of the mechanism of action of these proteins, we aim to underpin the development of sustainable, environmentally friendly, and economically viable pest management alternatives, to optimise crop yields and provide strategies for domestic and global food security.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Existing timber structures constructed with conventional cross-laminated timber (CLT) encounter limitations such as one-way bending in floor and roof slabs, as well as the necessity for closely spaced columns, leading to thick slabs with reduced material efficiency. These limitations hinder the industry from using timber as widely as concrete and steel materials in various types of buildings. This project aims to develop a novel two-way CLT slab system enabling engineers to build lightweight, large-span, thin CLT slabs, representing a new generation of cost-effective timber construction. This will address the industry gaps in efficient timber design for strength and serviceability. The manufacturing techniques and design guidelines to be developed have the potential to be adopted by industry and integrated into building and construction policies. The proposed efficient two-way CLT construction solution will overcome the shortage in timber supply, foster advanced manufacturing in timber engineering, and create jobs for the Australian forestry and timber industry. Project outcomes will support the Australian Government’s commitment to increase timber construction by 2030 to build near-zero resilient buildings, the QLD Government’s Brisbane 2032 commitment to deliver a carbon-positive Olympics, and the UN Sustainability Development Goals. Strategies such as industry seminars, publications and digital platforms will be employed to reach a diverse audience and facilitate adoption.",

Understanding heme regulation is crucial for farming and livestock, as excess heme causes mastitis in dairy cows, and environmental metal poisoning blocks heme synthesis leading to animal deaths, which is detrimental to Australia's $13 billion cattle industry. The processes discovered here may also benefit biotechnology by developing new heme-binding proteins that can improve human health or have industrial uses. To ensure our findings reach beyond academia, we will share discoveries through social media, highlight research in mainstream media, and engage with industry leaders who may benefit from this work. Additionally, this project will train the next generation of scientists, improve international collaborations by partnering with leading global research institutions, facilitating knowledge exchange and fostering future joint projects. These efforts aim to maximise the understanding, application and adoption of our research, ensuring it positively impacts Australian society",

    "summary": "Advancing Millimeter-Wave Base Station Antennas for 5G and 6G Deployment. The crucial mm-wave spectrum of 5G, pivotal for unlocking the full potential of next-generation networks, remains largely untapped. This project aims to pioneer the design and development of an innovative mm-wave base station with significantly reduced financial costs and energy consumption, paving the way for mm-wave network deployment. Central to this endeavor is the elimination of the amplitude modulation module required in current designs for beamforming. This introduces two scientific challenges, which can be addressed by the development of two groundbreaking antenna techniques: 'polarization-mixing enabled beamforming' and 'near-field beam focusing lenses'.",

However, the deployment of 5G networks—particularly in the higher millimetre-wave frequency bands—has been slow, largely due to the high manufacturing costs and energy consumption of '5G-ready' base stations. This project aims to develop new antenna technologies that can significantly reduce these associated costs. \n\nThis project will facilitate the large-scale deployment of cost-effective and energy-efficient wireless networks in the future. The advancement in wireless networks will benefit Australians with enhanced quality in telecommunication services and enable transformative technologies such as smart cities, smart agriculture, and advanced robotics, thereby driving economic growth across multiple sectors.\n\nThe antenna array to be developed in this project also holds significant commercial potential. Leveraging on our existing industrial collaborations, we will actively promote our research outcomes at industrial workshops. For future research translation, we plan to collaborate with Australian manufacturers to boost Australia’s advanced manufacturing capabilities and work with telecommunications operators to facilitate the integration of new base station antennas across Australian neighbourhoods.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "CubeSats, modular standardised small satellites, have gained significant popularity in the past decade. CubeSat antennas, essential for maintaining reliable communication between space and Earth, occupy a substantial portion of the satellite system. Reducing their weight and size is critical to easing payload pressure for easier launches. Current CubeSat antenna technologies are constrained by traditional three-dimensional (3D) design and manufacturing limitations. 4D printing CubeSat antennas with motor-free self-deployment mechanisms remain unexplored. The proposed project aims to create 4D (3D in space plus 1D in time) passive beam-steering antennas with motor-free self-deploying and self-folding mechanisms using shape-transformable 4D printing materials. This project will also support the in-space fabrication of additively manufactured CubeSat antenna arrays, focusing on Earth Observation and Communications Technologies. Successfully delivering this project will place Australia at the forefront of reliable satellite communications research, enhancing the execution and longevity of CubeSat missions. Leveraging advanced 3D printing facilities, the project will provide a \"Made in Australia\" solution using locally hosted resources. Students involved will receive world-class training in advanced manufacturing facilities and CubeSat antenna design, equipping them with practical skills beyond academia and maximising the use and adoption of the research in their future careers.",

Many of these older women will be impacted by sexual violence, to the serious detriment of their well-being. Despite this, there is a tendency to view sexual violence as an issue affecting only younger women, neglecting the voices and needs of women in later life. This project fills a critical gap in knowledge by aiming to understand older women’s experiences of sexual violence, its context and impacts in older age, and how it is represented in law and in the media. Findings will be translated into a suite of resources to strengthen trauma-informed responses across health, justice and social services, ensure that policies are inclusive, address ageist attitudes in the community, and promote help-seeking for victim/survivors. This will generate social and cultural benefits for Australians – particularly older women – through increased understanding of the hidden problem of sexual violence in this cohort, amplified community awareness and improved service delivery through the development of education modules, guidelines and an exhibition. The project addresses the strategic national priority area of violence against women, contributing to the reduction of its economic and social cost. ",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Quantum computers have the potential to solve complex problems in fields such as cryptography, optimisation, drug discovery and material science much faster than classical computers. The past decade has witnessed rapid expansion in quantum computing hardware capabilities but to unlock their full potential, we also need to develop quantum software in a comprehensive and systematic way. Because human intuition is better suited for classical computing than quantum computing, quantum programming is more error-prone, making it difficult to ensure the correctness of quantum programs. This project tackles this challenge by establishing the theoretical groundwork for refinement techniques in quantum programming. As Australia houses key players like Silicon Quantum Computing, successful outcomes from this project will fortify the country's leadership in quantum computing. The anticipated software development tools and methodologies can seamlessly integrate with Australia's quantum hardware, enhancing its value and contributing to the National Science and Research Priority of \"advanced manufacturing\". To promote our research beyond academia, we intend to release key software components as open-source projects, conduct workshops and training sessions for professionals and policymakers at industry events like Quantum Australia, and partner with leading Australian quantum technology companies such as Q-CTRL to integrate our quantum software tools into practical applications.",

Their unique physical and chemical properties make them a more effective and low-cost alternative to materials currently used in these applications. However, their use is hindered by the lack of reliable synthesis processes. Therefore, this project aims to develop new efficient and cost-effective fabrication methods for boron nanomaterials to support next-generation technologies. The effectiveness of these materials will then be tested in real world scenarios – energy, water and  environmental sensing – which are relevant to Australia. Adoption of the new materials will be facilitated through collaboration with our existing and emerging industry partners in Australia. The research outcomes have potential to open up new opportunities for: chemical manufacturing in Australia; the harvesting of sustainable osmotic energy; and the production of gas sensors that could be used for food spoilage detection and tracking of air pollution. Boron nanomaterials will also have potential applications in the manufacture of solar-driven water evaporation systems that could benefit Australians during droughts. Integrated into this project are training opportunities for researchers to build knowledge and capability in materials sciences.",

This project aims to develop an innovative wastewater-based surveillance system capable of simultaneously detecting various human pathogens and accurately predicting their associated case numbers, hospital admissions, and intensive care unit admissions, weeks in advance. This will provide insights to assist public health authorities in policymaking and resource planning for outbreaks. Ultimately, the proposed system will reduce pathogen infections and alleviate taxpayers' financial burden by reducing the cost of hospital/medical treatments and loss of productivity due to human pathogen infections, bringing tangible health, social and economic benefits for the entire Australian population. The outcomes are adaptable to different regions and countries. This initiative positions Australia as a global leader in wastewater-based early warning systems for outbreak management and opens a global market for commercialization. The project team’s networks with water industry and health department will ensure that the research results reach water and health authorities for implementation, and outcomes achieved beyond academia.",

    "summary": "Bio-Inspired Novel Vibration Isolators Incorporating Triple-Functionality. This project aims to develop bio-inspired novel vibration isolators by innovative integration of quasi-zero stiffness structures with magnetorheological elastomer driven by vibration energy. The project creates a new concept of transforming harmful vibration energy to mitigate vibration itself and expects to generate new design methodologies in vibration isolation. Expected outcomes include new vibration isolation knowledge, and a three-function based framework leveraging bio-inspired mechanisms for self-adaptive and self-powering abilities. Success of the project provides significant benefits to many systems in aerospace, defence and manufacturing engineering, where vibration protections are essential for safety, operation and economy.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Low-frequency vibrations, such as those occurring in flexible structures and tall buildings, military vehicles, naval ships and mobile mining machinery, can cause a range of problems if not properly mitigated. Prolonged exposure to vibrations can lead to fatigue and degradation in these structures, cause lower back pain or even disability in vehicle drivers and machinery operators, and cause inaccuracies and malfunctions of sensitive equipment. Inspired by skeletal and neuromuscular systems from nature, we propose a new approach to minimise vibration-caused adverse impacts on structures, equipment and people, by converting harmful vibration energy to counteract the vibration itself, leading to bio-inspired novel isolators with triple functionality. These isolators will have broad applications for naval, defence, aerospace, civil and mining industries, where vibration protections are essential for safety, operation and the economy. For example, the implementation of the isolators into mobile mining machinery could greatly reduce vibration-induced musculoskeletal injuries, benefiting one-third of the machinery operators in the Australian mining industry. This project is expected to expand the knowledge base of bio-inspired vibration isolation technology and enhance research capability in this area through researcher training. Our established industry networks will facilitate the promotion and translation of our research outcomes within the mining and manufacturing sectors.",

Australia slipped down the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index from 15th in 2006 to 50th out of 156 countries in 2021. The Government has committed to restoring Australia’s gender equality global leadership through its Working for Women Strategy 2024-2034. This project will provide evidence to bring the missing gender perspective to legislation, enabling the Government’s gender equality work. Using Tasmania’s Joint Sessional Gender and Equality Audit Committee, the ACT’s Standing Committee on the Economy and Gender and Economic Equality and comparative knowledge generated from long-standing committees in Canada and Spain, this project will determine whether auditing of bills by parliamentary committees is effective and if so, how. By evaluating whether auditing of parliamentary bills can re-centre women’s experiences in law-making, we will arrive at an understanding of whether law’s potential to advance gender equality has been optimised. The Project will offer a framework to be adapted and translated to the parliamentary work of Australian states and territories and even federally. Leveraging existing contacts with parliamentarians e.g. Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians and non-profit organisations, the findings will help improve the work of existing committee members, while providing a platform to advocate for the experiences of a diversity of women to directly or indirectly shape law reform.",

It can be framed as a choice under uncertainty regarding both risks and benefits. Our project aims to provide new knowledge on these risks and benefits by using state-of-the-art methods in econometric evaluation to estimate the effect of birth setting on birth outcomes, including both maternal and child health indicators, mental wellbeing, intervention rates, hospital service utilisation, and the probability of future pregnancy. We aim to equip regulators and administrators with the requisite knowledge to govern the actions of hospitals and treating physicians by identifying whether and how private provision of health care is leading to better (or worse) outcomes. The interplay between public and private provision of health care is controversial and divisive; access to private care for those who can afford it raises questions about equity and fairness, while the different incentives for physicians in each sector might actually work against private patients, a risk that may not be clear to them. Our results will benefit Australians by providing empirical evidence for better oversight and regulation in the provision of care across both sectors, and empower women to make better informed choices on birth setting. Findings will be communicated to clinicians and policy makers through professional networks and non-academic research outputs.",

This project explores human-algorithm interactions for the designing and implementation of economic and social policies in complex environments, employing experimental economics and computational economic theory. The specific focus is on differences between policies designed for humans versus robots and variations in human behaviour under each. The project's significance lies in providing insights for adapting and leveraging policies toward more positive economic outcomes in the age of advanced technologies. Through innovative experiments at both the micro and macro policy levels, this research aims to formulate specific advice on optimal policy design for effective outcomes in the evolving realm of human-AI interaction.",

AI is expanding into healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, and finance. Designed to help achieve human goals and surpass our limits of rationality, AI systems are also met with resentment due to their opaqueness and potential to displace human jobs. Fair and safe AI should align with human preferences, and its effectiveness relies on human trust and  seamless interactions with humans. This project will explore the complexities of human-AI interactions using a multidisciplinary approach that integrates game theory, experimental economics, and computational methods. We aim to analyse human behaviour to understand what promotes or hinders AI adoption and develop policies for improved AI integration. To this end, we will develop economic experiments to study how the presence of AI influences human decisions and how humans design rules for AI systems interacting with humans. The practical implications will be discussed with policymakers and industry professionals through workshops and roundtables. The project will inform the Australian Federal Government's AI Ethics Framework, including its principles related to human, societal, and environmental well-being, and fairness. A deeper understanding of AI-human interactions will help position Australia at the forefront of AI adoption trends, boosting productivity and enhancing well-being.",

The mechanisms that enable the gut and lung epithelium to respond to stimuli and perform its function to maintain homeostasis are critical, but ill-defined. We have developed novel tools and expertise that enable the elucidation of how specialised epithelial M cells and Tuft cells: 1. respond to bacterial metabolites and signal to immune cells to maintain homeostasis; 2. interact; and 3. how metabolite signals are altered in their absence in the gut and 4. lung. We will define the molecular crosstalk mechanisms that coordinate epithelial-immune function.

Their barriers absorb metabolites that are transduced to immune cells to instruct their development and maturation. This is crucial for normal gut and lung homeostasis as well as immunity and protection of the tissues.  Specialised cells in the gut and lung barriers perform these functions but how they do this is not understood. These cells are difficult to study but we have developed unique tools (reporter & knock-out mice) that enable us to elucidate these events. We will expose these mice to a range of metabolites with known biological effects. We will analyse all the genes and proteins in all cell types in the gut and lungs of these mice. We will define how metabolites change the numbers of cells and how they drive changes in immune cells. We will also determine how these cells interact and define how metabolite signals are altered in their absence. 2. Understanding these processes will define what are the optimal metabolites to induce by diet, microbiota or adding the metabolites themselves. This will have major benefits for gut and lung health in farm animals, pets and people, which in future can be translated into agricultural and medical treatments resulting in health, economic and commercial benefits. 3. Adoption of our findings will be promoted and translated through publications, conferences, agricultural and medical societies, public engagement and popular books as we regularly do.",

It motivates many areas of government policy, including taxes and transfers, education, health, housing, social services and labour market policy. This project consists of ten interdependent studies, which will together provide a clear contemporary picture of Australian economic inequality and intergenerational mobility, and their drivers. It will therefore inform policies which enhance economic opportunity in Australia. Particular foci include the roles of housing, tax avoidance, inheritances and gifts, income tax progressivity, and the causal intergenerational effects of welfare receipt, labour market shocks, parental careers, and peer influences. It will leverage rich, newly available, administrative and survey data. It will also collect new data on Australians' aspirations for their children, and their perceptions of inequality and mobility. It will study how those views are shaped by earlier experiences, and how they affect parenting behaviour. The project design includes extensive engagement with external stakeholders, especially government bodies and advocacy groups, as well as dissemination in academic and non-academic forums. Whilst the focus is Australia, each study will also make theoretical and methodological contributions to the international understanding of economic inequality and mobility.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Agricultural, aquatic, biomedical and environmental testing demand rapid and on-site screening of diverse biological particles. These particles often have inherently distinct non-spherical shapes, including disease-causing bacteria, algae, blood cells, and yeast cells. The shape of these bioparticles provide crucial information about environmental changes and the status of diseases, informing decision-making in areas such as climate change, healthcare, food safety and production.\n\nMagnetic materials are widely used for labelling biological particles, enabling the development of advanced particle separation and detection techniques for these applications. However, existing techniques overlook the shape of non-spherical particles, leading to inefficient separation and detection of these biological particles.\n\nOur project will generate essential knowledge about the interactions between magnetic fields, particle shapes, and fluid flows in microscale channels. This will drive the development of next-generation technologies for efficiently separating and detecting non-spherical biological particles. Australians will benefit through lower production costs and an improvement in the safety and quality of products in the agriculture, aquatic, healthcare and environmental sectors.  Research outcomes will be promoted via engagement with industry partners and participating in conferences on sensor technologies, analytical chemistry, life sciences, and biomedicine.\n",

This research will benefit Australians by providing novel insights to tackle pressing societal and environmental challenges, such as violence against women, the well-being of marginalised Australians, and attitudes towards the environment and climate, which cost billions of dollars annually. Socially and culturally, it will identify strategies to reduce intergroup tensions, improve social cohesion, and strengthen our national identity by promoting values of compassion and inclusivity. To maximise the impact of our findings, we will engage with policymakers, community groups, and utilise targeted communication strategies to develop actionable guidelines, policy recommendations, and training materials. Our efforts will ensure that the research outcomes are widely understood and adopted, leading to evidence-based policies and practices. By making our research accessible and actionable, we aim to deliver tangible benefits to all Australians, ultimately fostering a more compassionate and inclusive society.",

The under-representation of women and people from culturally diverse backgrounds in STEM is well-known – currently only 15% of the STEM workforce is women - but to date efforts to correct the problem have failed to improve participation. \n\nBy delivering this project, award-winning filmmakers, scientists and animators will design and test a new model of communicating science to primary school aged children. The project will produce a suite of learning resources that will include an animated science series and graphic science textbooks linked to curriculum, a scholarly book, and a science communication documentary. The research-driven, user-tested series will be made available for broadcast and for use within Australian classrooms by teachers and students. All outputs will be used to help boost interest in STEM careers amongst children, whilst fostering a culture of scientific curiosity and discovery within broader society. \n\nBenefits to the community will include the nurturing of a more inclusive, gender-balanced and resilient workforce, helping to deliver on urgent Australian government priorities relating to gender equity initiatives in STEM. Further benefits will include other fields adopting the developed model for the translation of their own important discoveries and the communication of other types of complex information. ",

It will determine the fundamental mechanism of cell division in an archaeal model organism that is common in Australian salt-lake environments (Haloferax volcanii), and thereby identify key commonalities and differences amongst archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic cell division mechanisms. This is expected to lead to future improvements in the selectivity of a wide range of treatments targeting cell division, such as antimicrobials and the control of archaeal methane emissions in agriculture. The project also takes a pioneering step towards the ground-up engineering of stable synthetic archaeal division and nano-fiber systems in advanced bio-manufacturing.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project aims to decipher how archaeal cells divide. Archaea are one of the three major groupings of life on earth, but very little is known of their replication compared to other cells. By understanding how archaea divide, this project expects to contribute to identifying the important features of this process in all cells, including bacteria and complex cells like human cells. Such comparisons will benefit the design of specific therapeutic interventions seeking to inhibit cell division, such as antimicrobial and anticancer treatments. Archaea are recognised as central players in global carbon and nitrogen cycles and in the origin of complex cellular life. For example, archaea are the cause of essentially all biological generation of methane. The project’s outcomes could inform the development of interventions to reduce the replication of methane-generating archaea in agriculture, reducing global warming. The project also aims to build a new synthetic biology platform for deciphering how protein molecules work together in archaeal division. This can be utilized in diverse applications of synthetic biology for use in biotechnology, medicine or agriculture. This will sit at the leading edge of a large emerging market for synthetic biology that has been forecast as a ‘critical technology’ in Australian government priority research reports and by CSIRO.",

By using non-invasive brainwave measurements, it will overcome the current impediment of easily translating silent speech into words, which would benefit an extensive range of Australian end-users.\n\nIn the care sector, patients suffering from temporary paralysis or people living with a disability will be able to communicate and interact much easier with other people and with assistive technologies. This would not only lessen the increasing care demands on an already challenged workforce, but also improve human quality of life. Other plausible application areas are in the automotive, defence and news/entertainment industries.\n\nPromotion of the research outcomes beyond academia will be achieved through various means. Firstly, open-source publication of the AI model and source code will allow the general public and industry to test and adopt the results, paving the path for technological and social adoption. Secondly, public-facing workshops, mainstream media publications and industry seminars will further assist potential translation, especially by collaboration with the fast-growing Australian assistive technologies industry sector. This is expected to result in job creation by enhancing Australia’s technological and commercial capacity, as well as socially contribute to safer, more effective and economically viable AI technologies ‘made in Australia’.",

Currently, hydrogen gas is either compressed or liquefied for storage and delivery, which are costly and unsafe options, and roadblocks in Australia’s development of a large-scale hydrogen economy. Therefore, this project will develop a new materials-based hydrogen storage solution to store and transport hydrogen at large scale (up to hundreds of tonnes) that is safe, reliable and cost-effective. In so doing, the project will generate new knowledge for the design and syntheses of these novel hydrogen storage materials. Adoption of our research outcomes will be facilitated through collaborations with our existing and emerging industry partners in Australia’s growing hydrogen sector. The research outcomes are also expected to have broader economic and commercial opportunities for other Australian industries, including chemical manufacturing, green fertiliser production and transport. Our research is expected to contribute to decarbonising the Australian economy, to the development of an export pipeline for Australian green hydrogen and to the Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy.",

This project aims to protect user privacy by decomposing data storage and recommendation model training.\n \nThe proposed research aligns with Australia’s National Science and Research Priorities in Cybersecurity and CSRIO’s Australian AI Strategy. It will improve Australia’s well-being by enabling organisations to use Australian users’ data with privacy preservation. For example, the government can utilize the recommender system to generate suggestions for people who are in need.\n \nThe project’s proposed framework can help service providers conduct recommendations with better compliance with privacy law, e.g. GDPR, and also create new recommendation applications that were hampered by privacy concerns. By working with existing industry partners and UTS’ collaboration network, we will adopt the proposed framework to industrial applications, e.g. billboard recommendations, and suggestion recommendations for self-management healthcare.",

There are myriad conditions in which mtDNA escapes its mitochondrial confines and once outside of its organelle, mtDNA becomes a potent danger signal to the cell, with potentially debilitating consequences to the organism. This project is focused on understanding the biological processes that allow mtDNA escape outside not just the mitochondria, but outside the cell itself. The study builds on discoveries made by a team with world-leading expertise in mitochondrial biology and microscopy – and brings innovative, cutting-edge techniques in cell biology and imaging to investigate a fundamental biological phenomenon for which the cellular mechanism is currently unknown.",

Once outside, mtDNA causes inflammation in humans and animals alike. This project addresses a fundamental unanswered question: how does mtDNA escape outside a cell? We will provide the first clear picture of mtDNA release and novel insights into this biological process. As such, the knowledge gain from this study has the ability to significantly impact the direction of future research & industry collaborations into the treatment of multiple agricultural and human conditions. For example: cell-free mtDNA has been found in cattle suffering mastitis- a condition that costs the Australian dairy industry ~35 million/yr- with no understanding of how the mtDNA got there. Thus, insights from this project could have major economic benefits to our nation’s third largest rural industry. Further, mtDNA signalling is an emerging target in neurodegenerative and auto-immune conditions, thus (whilst beyond the scope of this project) our findings have the long-term potential to uncover new avenues for treating these major health burdens, with significant social and economic benefits to the Australian population. To maximise the understanding and translation of our research, all findings will be freely available through open access journals online, and directly communicated with any consumer/industry groups with potential benefits from our work.",

This endeavour will additionally: (1) advance deep understanding of chemistry associated with phase change material; and (2) establish novel design principles for hybrid non-reinforcement of phase change material integrated recycled concrete, leveraging the complementary properties of graphene and calcium carbonate. The energy savings achieved using the proposed concrete will not only bring economic benefits but also contribute to environmental preservation by recycling waste and reducing carbon emissions. Deploying cutting-edge innovation in EnergyPlus modelling and life cycle assessment will undoubtedly widen the dissemination and application of this project, which drives scientific advancements and effectively addresses multifaceted societal challenges for the future.",

This project will be the first to develop a comprehensive screen-based assessment of children’s foresight abilities, including their capacities to think ahead, to prepare and to plan for the future. The tasks will build upon our own world-leading laboratory research on the development of foresight to create an efficient, reliable, and multifaceted assessment tool that features a diverse array of tasks exploring different aspects of foresight, each with easily adjustable difficulty levels. Subsequently, two large-scale studies will use this tool to chart the development of foresight across early and middle childhood, providing novel insights into how different aspects of foresight emerge, develop, and relate to each other throughout childhood. This project will place Australia centre-stage in advancing our understanding of one of the most elusive and powerful features of the human mind. Findings from this project stand to have wide-reaching implications, including supporting teachers and caregivers in understanding what can be expected at various stages and when children may need extra support. Our assessment tool will be easily adjustable for future use with clinical populations. By providing a foundational resource, the outcomes of this project have the potential to aid future efforts aimed at facilitating the development of more prudent and farsighted citizens. \n      ",

The best chance of survival for these populations is to adapt to their new environment. Unfortunately, there are very few natural systems with the population replication needed to inform us on what helps this process. Here we use a wild lizard that has hundreds of discrete populations to identify the key factors in the wild that help species adapt to a changing environment. The lizards live on granite outcrops that have persisted through land clearing, but now have a drastically altered surface colour. We have observed population declines and extinction, but also numerous populations where lizards have seemingly changed colour to match this new environment. By determining the genetic and environmental factors that facilitated this rapid change and promote population persistence, we can advise conservation managers on the parameters best prioritised in their management of vulnerable populations. In so doing we will help realise the federal government’s 10-year plan for a zero extinctions target for Australian species and to support species resilience. Potential benefits will be translated outside of academia via communications with stakeholders in conservation agencies, government and natural resource management. The proposed research will also continue to build a long-term field model system of value to Australian science over-and-above the immediate benefits outlined.",

However, it is unknown whether the same is true in other animals, or beyond the animal kingdom, in plants. We will address whether mtDNA is a danger signal in multiple species of animals & plants, and potentially identify entirely novel receptors that function in plant immunity.

Specifically, this project utilizes cells from cows, sheep and rice, and thus may have direct implications for cattle & sheep immunity, and rice crop production – three industries that each generate revenues in the billions for Australia every year. Long term, this research could provide significant economic benefits to Australian agriculture, with the potential for decreased loss of animals/plants, and increased yields for multiple industries.

This project aims to advance understanding of cognitive inertia, where decision-makers persist in choosing familiar but inferior decision options, and how to best respond to this problem. A new conceptual framework explaining how inertia develops will be tested through an integrated program of experimental research and computational modeling. The expected outcomes are advances in our understanding of the cognitive processes that drive inertia and how these may differ between individuals, and the development of more effective methods for preventing or reversing inertia. This will provide significant benefits by guiding better decision making in domains such as finance, environmental sustainability, and health.",

Problems in decision-making often arise through cognitive inertia - sticking with a familiar option when better alternatives are available (e.g., failing to consider a more sustainable energy plan that will be cheaper in the long run). However, the reasons why people often persist with choosing inferior options are not well understood. This project aims to evaluate a new model of cognitive inertia in order to improve decision quality. We will use the model to develop new ways of helping people to explore their options and hence make better decisions. Project results will be communicated to Australian government agencies and relevant industry stakeholders, and could lead to new ways of presenting information about decision options when communicating with the public. In turn, this will lead to communities that are better equipped to critically appraise the information they receive and subsequently make more informed decisions, including those guiding what we buy and how we live.

This project will reveal a crucial way the body attempts to maintain status quo when challenged by its environment. It will enhance Australia’s research capacity by combining immunology with molecular and cell biology to expand our understanding of how the conserved process of cell death affects the immune system. As this work will be shared via research papers and presentations, and via news, social media and public lectures, it will boost Australia’s profile and direct future research. While still in the discovery phase, this research could eventually bolster Australia’s biotechnology sector via the creation of new tools. By identifying therapeutic targets, it may lead to immunomodulatory drug development to protect Australia’s $34.6 billion livestock industry from threats, such as respiratory infections in cattle that cause >50% of all feedlot deaths.

This technology is designed to address critical needs, including safety and risk prevention guarantees, that current techniques for practical decision-making often fail to meet. Consequently, it is expected to bring significant benefits to many different fields where optimization is used for complex decision-making.  \n\nThis project introduces an improved optimization technology that integrates safety and risk prevention assurances, thereby enhancing not only cost-effectiveness and performance but also the quality and reliability of decisions made. If successfully implemented, this technology could have a big impact across various areas like managing investment portfolios, distributing energy, and planning radiation treatments. This impact will be achieved through improved asset allocations, reduced distribution costs and enhanced treatment plans. \n\nThe project will also create knowledge and advanced computer models to develop decision-support tools with economic benefits for Australia, especially in industries like banking, finance and healthcare where making safe decisions is crucial. The biggest national benefits will likely be seen in cutting-edge technologies such as advanced radiotherapies and artificial intelligence where existing systems may have limitations without safety guarantees.\n\n",

The ability to learn new motor skills declines with advancing age, but the cause of this decline, or how to alleviate it, remains elusive. This project will use a novel form of non-invasive brain stimulation combined with multimodal techniques to investigate how synchronising brain oscillations at specific frequencies can improve motor learning in older adults. This cutting-edge approach will provide new information on the neurophysiological basis of synchronised brain oscillations and how they can be optimised to improve motor function. The outcomes may have wide-ranging implications for the design of training protocols aimed at improving motor and cognitive function, providing potential benefits in ageing and in rehabilitation.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The deterioration of motor function with advancing age is a major cause of loss of independence and reduced ability to work. This results in a substantial personal, social and economic impact for Australia’s older population, as motor function not only underpins skilled movements, but the basic tasks we take for granted in our everyday lives. While we know that changes in the brain contribute to age-related declines in motor skills, the specific brain processes that contribute to this decline are not well understood. This project will take a unique approach to this problem by using a novel brain stimulation technique to manipulate specific brain rhythms that are known to change with age and are thought to be important for motor function. These studies will identify how specific brain rhythms contribute to the age-related decline in voluntary movement, and how these brain rhythms can be manipulated to rejuvenate motor function in the elderly. These findings will be provided to government organisations and community groups focusing on healthy ageing, where they may inspire new ways to maintain optimal brain and motor function throughout the lifespan to improve quality of life for older Australians. This may ultimately lead to the development of strategies to delay the functional declines that often lead to frailty, promoting better outcomes for ageing and reducing aged-care costs for the Australian government in the face of a changing age demographic in our country.",

In order to promote these benefits, we will work with the Monash Data Futures Institute, E61 Institute at Macquarie University, and Institute for Climate Risk & Response at UNSW to organize workshops for this team to demonstrate the research outcomes, along with online computational algorithms, the data and software packages. The target audiences include empirical researchers and industry practitioners from different governmental organizations and industry partners, such as the Australian Bureau of Metrology, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the CSIRO and the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The project contributes to Australia’s national interests by shedding a new light on the fundamental mechanisms of human tooth wear and its specific role in the efficiency and health of our masticatory system. It is our intention to establish a new hub in evolutionary dentistry, which may eventually have the capacity to promote and shape new national strategies in preventing tooth decays, teeth grinding and gum infections. Furthermore, the results of this project can potentially attract the interest of food industry for designing and manufacturing new food products with particular benefits for people with difficulty in swallowing. The findings will engage the non-scientific community about dental functional biology through outreach programs (such as visiting schools, participation in events that promote sciences awareness, and giving public lectures) and they will raise the profile of Australian science around the world.",

G protein-coupled receptors are the largest protein family encoded by the human genome and the largest class of drug target. These receptors are located on the cell membrane and transduce extracellular signals into physiological effects within the cell. This proposal aims to develop new chemical-biology probes for selectively targeting signalling pathways mediated by these receptors using the M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor as an exemplar.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "A significant challenge in the life sciences is understanding how chemicals outside the cell signal to proteins inside the cell, how this produces a biological response and how these responses can be controlled by synthetic molecules. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell surface signalling proteins and are responsible for the regulation of numerous vital physiological functions. They are also an important drug target, with over 30% of currently approved pharmaceuticals acting at these receptors. Despite their importance, much remains to be learned about the way in which small molecules regulate GPCRs. This project will generate new knowledge on how these receptors signal into the cell to produce their associated biological effects and will also develop novel approaches to control these processes. These goals will be achieved by developing tool molecules which interact with these receptors via novel binding modes that confer greater selectivity for the desired biological response and reduce unwanted side effects. In terms of expected outcomes, the proof of concept achieved in this study has the potential to advance new paradigms for the development bioactive molecules with more selective modes of action. This would provide significant benefits to Australia such as the generation of new intellectual property as well as the catalysis of commercial/translational activity and has the potential to afford significant downstream health benefits.",

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is an emerging encryption technology that allows computation on encrypted data and has the potential to significantly reduce the likelihood of cloud computing data privacy breaches. However, a major practical barrier is that existing HE technology only provides privacy against cloud data eavesdropping attacks, but is vulnerable to a more realistic class of attacks known as active attacks, involving malicious data modification and injection. This project will address this problem by devising novel practical cryptographic algorithms for safeguarding a range of HE-based cloud computation applications against active attacks, enjoying strong security guarantees. The project will develop and evaluate an open-source active security software toolkit suitable for integration with existing HE technology. The toolkit will help enable Australian businesses to securely adopt HE technology to their cloud computing applications and significantly reduce their risk of data privacy breaches. The project will also train sovereign research and development capabilities in a cutting edge cybersecurity technology.",

However, current generative computational design systems struggle to effectively design with these complex, heterogeneous materials.\n\nThis project will accelerate digital transformation in Australia’s creative industries by enabling practical realisation of radically new forms of design. By creating zero-emission, sustainable prototypes, it will promote awareness and adoption among design professionals, yielding environmental, economic, and cultural benefits and advancing Australian design innovation. Additionally, the project will help catalyse innovation in building construction and enhance the uptake of additive manufacturing.\n\nThe research will be disseminated through architectural demonstrators, academic papers, online media, and open-source code libraries. Architectural demonstrator projects will showcase the research’s direct application to architectural design. A public media hub will provide access to computer code, material processes, robotic configurations, and other essential data for fabricating with biomaterials, allowing others to replicate and expand on the project's research.",

The new NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite mission called NISAR will provide the data needed to make this possible, but the algorithms to interpret the data still need to be developed and tested for Australian conditions. This project not only lays the foundation for the new satellite capability required to meet this need, but will also provide the necessary verification of NISAR soil moisture, burn and biomass estimates for Australian vegetation types and environments. The algorithms developed will be deployed globally through its NASA, ISRO and TERN partners and have the specific environmental benefit of gaining an understanding of carbon and climate change impacts in Australia. Results will be shared with application communities and policy makers through workshops, meetings, and conferences to achieve the best possible adaptation strategies. Successful demonstration of this radar sensing technology will also cement Australia’s position as a leader in soil moisture and vegetation monitoring.",

This technology is central for developing safe and trustworthy AI, ensuring compliance with privacy laws, and providing Australians with the \"right to be forgotten,\" allowing for the deletion of personal data, such as medical records, upon request. Furthermore, machine unlearning addresses the challenge of removing harmful content from AI applications, such as the generation of pornographic images, thereby safeguarding the ethical use of technology. By enhancing compliance with privacy laws and correcting harmful content, our project supports the broader use of AI in sectors such as healthcare, mining, energy, and public services in Australia. This will potentially lead to improvements in personal data security for all Australians, promoting a safer digital environment. Another advantage of our project is that it ensures AI systems can comply with regulations without the need to retrain from scratch, promoting a more sustainable technological environment. We will actively promote the outcomes of our research through public engagements, educational workshops, and industry collaborations. These efforts will make our advancements accessible and advantageous for all Australians, supporting Australia's leadership in ethical AI research globally.",

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in decision making procedures in many real-world applications, but weaknesses in the reasoning capability of black-box AI has led to the development of neuro-symbolic AI combining the strength of black-box learning with reasoning. This project aims to develop methods to formally reason about and explain decisions of neuro-symbolic AI systems. Expected outcomes of this project are effective methods to explain to humans why a neuro-symbolic AI system makes a certain decision, using formal methods so that explanations are guaranteed to be correct.

But despite the recent success, AI systems can be brittle, biased or make drastically wrong decisions. In order to take full advantage of the AI revolution, Australians need to trust the AI systems that make use of, which the results of this project will help make possible.\n\nThe research outcomes of this project will be made widely available as easy to use, well documented open-source software packages for evaluating AI systems, thus making it simple for developers of neuro-symbolic AI systems to interrogate the reasons why their systems make certain decisions, and hence improve them. We will run tutorials at major AI conferences to disseminate the results of the project as well as through publications.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Worldwide glacier retreat due to global warming is causing sea level rise and changes in global water availability, risking coastal assets and geopolitical security in Australia. However, a less understood but critically important risk of glacier retreat is on mountain biodiversity worldwide. As ice retreats, exposing bedrock and new environments to colonisation, and removing ice-associated habitats, biodiversity devastation plays out. Heard Island, Australia's only glacier-covered territory is uniquely at risk because it contains a largely pristine ecosystem unaffected by local human impact. Our project will assess the changing biodiversity values of Heard Island which underpin its World Heritage status, and the impacts associated with current and projected glacier retreat. Alongside scientific publication and articles written for the public, our work will form the basis of policy briefs to government, outlining the impacts and risks posed by glacier retreat, and advising on strategies for securing its unique value. Doing so will help to ensure that Heard Island remains one of Australia's most important environmental assets for future generations of Australians.",

Pharmaceuticals, when they enter waterways and accumulate in the brains of wildlife, are of particular concern. Despite this growing threat, no research has considered the impact on animals’ cognition, which governs all their behaviour in response to their surrounds. This Project uses ecologically important fish species to test how pharmaceutical contaminants affect the cognition and behaviour of wildlife, in a coordinated suite of world-first laboratory and field experiments. Beyond the clear advances in new science, it will fill a serious practice and policy vacuum with information for identifying and managing an emerging type of pollution that poses serious ecological, health, and economic concerns—as underscored by recent fears over the contamination of drinking water. Our findings will enable predictions of how pharmaceuticals can put at risk fragile ecosystems and the unique species they support, informing the secure management of freshwater resources. By training new researchers, this effort will expand Australia’s reputation and capacity for conserving precious natural assets both locally and globally. The Project will draw on our team’s consultative networks with community stakeholders as well as its strong links with national and international regulatory agencies, yielding translatable discoveries to inform risk assessment and regulation in this vital domain.",

Such losses are expected under extreme climate change and land degradation. The research addresses the gap that the mass loss of individual plants and animals and the interactions between them have not yet been included in predictions of how climate change will affect nature and people, in Australia and elsewhere. The project aims to address this gap through analytical and computational innovation. The environmental benefits of this new research are being able to identify where in Australia this could happen, in which ecosystems, and to recognize its early signs so that government and land managers can intervene before the loss becomes irreversible. We will use our deep and well-established relationships with agencies responsible for nature in Australia and internationally to inform and guide the policy and management that underpins investment in nature to sustain people, agribusiness and tourism. We will build on our track record of experience on advisory committees, leading science-policy reports and volunteering to translate the outcomes and advance understanding of the research outcomes.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Gig-economy work is a rapidly growing form of labour. Gig-labour has been used increasingly by Australian business as it is more flexible, lower cost and scalable. Online platforms (e.g. Uber) organise labour for businesses by using 'self-employed' gig-workers. Gig-workers' contractor status, however, allows business and platforms to avoid labour protections provided to other forms of employment. As a result gig-work has less oversight, workers experience higher risks of injury, income insecurity, and discrimination, and service quality is lower. Firms and their supply chains can bridge the labour protections gap faced by gig-workers, however, especially given gig-work provides a growing range of services in firms' supply chains. The Project will investigate the role and perspectives of key stakeholders (business, platforms, workers, consumers) in gig-work labour protections. It seeks to identify supply chain solutions that maintain the flexibility and scalability of gig-based labour but also ensure minimum fair, safe working conditions. The Project improves Australian workers' access to sustainable gig-work which is a growing source of income for many. It also supports the economy by reducing gig-labour risks for industry which improves the resilience of Australia's supply chains. Project outcomes will inform recent government changes to the national employment system, and will be shared with industry, workers, and the international academic community.",

To maintain pace with this ever-increasing need requires new technologies that maximise the use of the magnets that underpin this technology. Developing such technologies requires improved understanding and characterisation of magnetic structures on increasingly small length scales. This project seeks to address a research gap in characterising magnetic structures by developing imaging theory and analysis tools to measure and map magnetic fields down to the fundamental atomic scale. By training the next generation of researchers and strengthening collaborative links with researchers in the USA and Japan, this project will help keep Australia at the forefront of advanced materials characterisation. By developing our understanding of magnetic materials, this project will provide tools and insights that will potentially lead to environmental benefits by enabling new developments in power-efficient electronics, and economic benefits by enabling improvements in data storage capacity. The algorithms produced by this project will be promoted through open-source software and workshops to both academic and industrial researchers for whom characterising magnetic structure at this scale provides the insights necessary to build the next generation of digital data storage technologies to meet the ongoing needs of all Australians.",

Many treaties permit states to rely on security as a guise for protectionism or other improper conduct with little or no judicial scrutiny, undermining the regime’s objective of global economic development. Yet, other treaties do not permit states  to act in relation to contemporary security threats such as energy security and cybersecurity, undermining their sovereign right to protect public welfare. This project, the first of its kind worldwide, will develop strategies for treaty drafting that ensure that global trade and investment are not hindered by spurious invocations of security, while safeguarding states’ ability to respond to genuine security threats. The project will benefit Australia’s economic interests by ensuring that Australia can protect its security interests without legal liability and by minimising the risk that other states will improperly invoke security to justify measures harming Australian businesses operating abroad. More broadly, the project will benefit the international community by proposing durable solutions to remedy the regime’s problems. The project’s recommendations will be disseminated to policymakers in Australia and internationally (with the assistance of the United Nations) to maximise their adoption.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Transistors are electronic switching devices that are ubiquitous in modern society. As the technology matured, the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubled every 18–24 months became known as Moor's law. For a long time, Moore's law predictions were true yearly, but not anymore. Traditional transistor technology has hit fundamental limits, mainly due to heat extraction issues. This project will address this challenge by developing new transistor technology that can increase the density of traditional transistors by providing an active thermal management pathway via thermotronic circuits powered by quantum thermal transistors. The proposed technology heavily depends on quantum effects, a critical technology the Australian government is actively targeting and promoting. This project will generate fundamental knowledge on analyzing transistor circuits built using both traditional transistors and quantum thermal transistors for the thermal management of conventional electronics. The resulting hybrid technology will be faster and more efficient. The resulting circuit laws, modified simulation software and the new hybrid thermotronic technology, will inform further research in Australia and help the Australian defence industry, universities and the global strategic microchip ecosystem. The associated intellectual property will enable licensing opportunities and commercialization pathways to boost critical manufacturing capability in Australia.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "X-ray imaging is used everywhere from airport baggage handling to medical imaging. However, image contrast can be poor because it only utilises X-ray absorption properties. X-ray exposure can be harmful, causing illnesses including cancer, leukemia and infertility. Matter also scatters X-rays and this property can provide enormous amounts of information about an object, yet this information is not captured by conventional X-ray imaging. Scattering can reveal the size, shape, orientation and surface area of otherwise invisible microstructures. We aim to show that this vast information can be captured using new scatter-based X-ray imaging technology, and that scatter can help reduce radiation exposure by factors in the thousands. Scatter information usually requires specialised X-ray sources and optics to be detected, but we aim to demonstrate that scatter-based imaging can be achieved using table-top X-ray systems for real-time, low-dose imaging with micron-scale resolution. The potential benefits of this technology include enhanced detection of illicit substances in airport security scanners, and safer X-ray imaging with greater diagnostic capability. The vast applications of this technology mean it could also have great commercial benefits for developing new X-ray imaging scanners. Successful outcomes will be promoted to potential industry partners and clinicians, with the aim of translating this technology for industrial and medical use.",

Most research on the immune system focuses on humans and mice, leaving a gap in our understanding on how the immune system works in other animals. This project will increase our knowledge of a novel type of immune cell that is found only in marsupials (e.g. kangaroos) and monotremes (e.g. platypuses). Understanding how these cells function and detect threats should lead to novel biotechnological developments. The outcomes of this project could therefore inform the development of treatments for animal diseases and protect Australian native animals threatened by disease (e.g. Tasmanian devils with facial tumour). This could ultimately fill a significant unmet need for conserving wildlife and provide a commercial and environmental benefit for Australia. The research outcomes will be promoted  and shared with communities, non-governmental and governmental organisations (Wildlife conservation), and policy makers through a series of workshops, meetings, and seminars, enabling them to collaborate on implementation.",

But unless appropriately managed and secured, this data has the potential to be stolen and used for identity theft, fraud, or to create fake images. The project will investigate Australians’ views on how posthumous digital data is and should be managed after people die or become permanently incapacitated. It will produce new evidence of people’s views and practices regarding posthumous data, using a series of stakeholder-oriented activities designed to ensure that practical strategies are aligned with community needs, priorities and values. The findings will assist the eSafety Commissioner, Services Australia, the ATO, and other organisations and companies that collect, store, and share data. They will provide the basis for policy and guidelines for government departments, patient groups, and businesses (e.g. legal services) on managing posthumous data, create tools to enable families to safeguard individuals’ data following their death or incapacity, and foster informed community debate on key issues.

Breakthrough cell biology is needed to identify new targets and new mechanisms of inhibition. This project aims to probe the susceptibility of bacteria to a novel “reaction-hijacking” mechanism, which has recently been discovered by our team. This work expects to catalogue targetable enzymes in bacteria and probe the inhibition mechanism using chemical, structural and cell biology approaches. Expected outcomes include the discovery of powerful chemical probes to study key metabolic enzymes in bacteria and a blueprint for the design of selective reaction-hijacking inhibitors.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australia’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy recognises that an ever-increasing number of bacterial infections cannot be effectively treated due to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). For example, ~40% of veterinary antibiotic treatments used in Australia work by blocking protein synthesis, but these treatments are at risk due to AMR, threatening Australia’s food security.\nWe are exploring a new class of antibacterial inhibitors that target protein synthesis - in a new and unexpected way. We have discovered a class of molecules that blocks a key machinery in the protein synthesis pathway by “hijacking” a naturally occurring biochemical reaction in the cell. These molecules can induce the enzymes to generate their own inhibitors, leading to the death of the cell. We seek to understand the chemical determinants of this unusual \"reaction hijacking\" mechanism, so that we can design compounds that are more potent and specific for bacterial pathogens. This work will lead to new candidate antibiotics for treatment of animal diseases important to Australia.\nThe project outcomes will be shared with industrial partners through meetings and conferences. In the longer term, this work could provide new routes to therapeutic interventions for bacterial infections of food animals and plants, and of humans. The work will generate new knowledge, build networks internationally and underpin new biotechnology applications to overcome global challenges in agriculture.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "All of our thoughts, sensations, actions, and emotions arise from various patterns of neural activity expressed across the brain through space and time. This project seeks to understand how these patterns are shaped by the anatomy of the brain by testing key predictions of a well-established mathematical model of brain-wide activity called Neural Field Theory (NFT). Specifically, the project aims to determine how the propagation of neural activity is fundamentally constrained by the brain's geometry (i.e., its size and shape) and how brain-wide activity can be amplified by periodic brain stimulation applied at the right location and frequency, triggering resonant responses (similar to tapping a pond repetitively to reinforce waves).\n\nCurrent evidence supporting NFT relies on relatively imprecise non-invasive imaging techniques in humans. This study will scrutinize the universality of NFT by examining species separated by over 87 million years of evolution: the mouse and the marmoset. This will be achieved through the application of state-of-the-art optical technologies for precise monitoring and control of brain-wide activity, available only in animal species.\n\nThis study will deepen our understanding of the roles played by neural connections and brain geometry in shaping neural dynamics. It also holds the potential to establish collaborations with the Australian MedTech industry to develop robust stimulation devices for cognitive enhancement.\n",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australia faces a $200B annual economic burden due to a mismatch in population distribution, leading to excess pollution, congestion, crime, and resource wastage. The population is predicted to double by 2066, worsening these issues. The Australian Government urges aligning the population with city capacity but struggles to find effective policy levers. This project aims to optimise the impending Australian high-speed rail network as a key policy tool to redistribute the population towards more sustainable city sizes. New methods are developed that go beyond conventional inter-census growth rates, employing a strategic approach to assess how new infrastructure might affect growth rates to determine sustainable city sizes. The project benefits Australia by ensuring the effectiveness of the $200B investment in high-speed rail, saving $5.5B annually in rental expenses, encouraging 44K more commuters to walk to work with health and environmental benefits, boosting community volunteering by 164K people, and saving millions annually by avoiding duplication in transport model development. It also provides new tools for pro-active population distribution management in Australia. The approach to impact builds on the CIs' extensive academic and policy networks. Project findings will be shared through policy and scientific advisory groups, experts involved in Delphi surveys and workshops, media releases, and policy briefs with local, state, and national governments for implementation.",

This project aims to investigate how organ failure during ageing leads to cause of death, and why individuals die of different causes. Understanding how an individual’s genetic make-up interacts with influences from the environment, like diet, to alter the ultimate cause of death is lacking, but is crucial for advancing knowledge of why animals age and designing strategies to ameliorate health decline during aging. This project aims to expand ageing theory to include individual and environmental variation in cause of death. Benefits include enhanced understanding of the evolution of ageing and long-term improvements for the development of healthy ageing interventions.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Everyone wants to live a long and healthy life. However, the decline in organ function that happens with ageing and eventual death is inevitable. This has prompted researchers to explore why organisms age, and to devise a one-size-fits-all solution to delay this process. The problem with a one-size-fits-all approach is that individuals die of different causes and genetic makeup, sex, and environmental conditions can alter cause of death.  Interventions to improve ageing outcomes that ignore this variation in cause of death are likely to be marginally beneficial, or even harmful, for many. This project aims to address this gap by identifying how and why the cause of death differs across individuals, sexes, and life experience using genetic model insects, fruit flies.\nThis work has the potential to change how we think about ageing in all animals, enhancing Australia’s reputation in ageing research. While this project explores fundamental principles of ageing in insects, long-term applications include changing gerontology practice to centre personalised solutions for ageing.\nOur research will be communicated to a broader audience by engaging with our science communication teams to develop press releases for Australian and International media and through social media channels, reaching millions of people in a matter of seconds. This will make our findings accessible to the public, as well as to practitioners aiming to improve health outcomes in Australia’s ageing population.",

This project aims to unravel the evolutionary implications of interactions between two endosymbionts - mitochondria and Wolbachia. All animals have mitochondria, and many carry the reproductive parasite Wolbachia. Each endosymbiont has profoundly shaped the evolutionary fitness of their hosts. Remarkably, however, each has been studied through different paradigms that ignored the capacity for the endosymbionts to directly interact to manipulate host function. Via an innovative approach, this project expects to generate new knowledge of the modes and mechanisms via which endosymbionts evolve, and the implications for their animal hosts.

Two of the most significant are mitochondria, the energy powerhouse of cells, and Wolbachia, a bacterium that can manipulate the reproductive and immune systems of their invertebrate hosts. Even though they reside side-by-side inside the cells of millions of species, they have only ever been studied separately. Incredibly, we have no knowledge of the capacity for these endosymbionts to interact with each other to shape the biology and evolution of their hosts. This project will redress this significant knowledge gap, opening a new frontier in the study of endosymbiosis. The project is expected to lead to significant national & international benefits. Wolbachia are key to biocontrol efforts; their introduction into mosquito populations blocks the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses, which would otherwise threaten the lives of millions of humans. By generating new insights into the implications to hosts of Wolbachia-mitochondrial interactions, the knowledge will have strong potential to shape development of more effective approaches to mosquito biocontrol. Project outcomes will be regularly discussed with Australian-leaders in Wolbachia-based biocontrol - the World Mosquito Program - and other stakeholders in biocontrol, such as CSIRO, through workshops and in-person meetings, thus enabling relevant insights to be incorporated into research & development pipelines.",

Solar energy generation could be significantly enhanced by “thermoradiative” energy harvesting which exploits outgoing thermal radiation emitted (even at night) by warm objects exposed to the sky, while still utilizing incoming sunlight. However current thermoradiative generators harvest only a miniscule fraction of the available energy. This project aims to develop radically new device designs based on the unusual electronic properties of graphene (one atom-thick carbon), integrated with advanced nanostructures to efficiently release thermal radiation into the cold environment, potentially realising orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvements. The project will develop intellectual property, and manufacture and test prototype devices, falling within the National Science and Research Priorities of Energy and Advanced Manufacturing. Near-term benefits of efficient thermoradiative devices to government and industry will be new technology for power generation at night for autonomous vehicles and microsatellites, boosting Australian space and defence capability. The project will train researchers in forefront nano- and opto-electronics, essential in tomorrow’s energy technologies. Results will be promoted via public science websites aimed at a broad audience, and shared with industry and government stakeholders through workshops and site-visits to forge new partnerships for translation.",

Presently, little is known about metabolite-mediated immunity, thereby representing a major knowledge gap.  The project aims to combine mass spectrometry, structural and biochemical approaches to learn how metabolites are (i) presented by an antigen presenting molecule called MR1 (ii) how this leads to activation by specific T lymphocytes. Outcomes will significantly advance current understanding of the molecular basis underpinning metabolite-mediated immunity. Major benefits will include fundamental new knowledge about immunity that may ultimately be used by the biotechnology industry.",

The national interest of this proposal lies in a) an advancement of basic knowledge in how metabolites modulate immune system function and b) the multi-disciplinary nature of the research proposal that will increase Australia’s research capacity within the life sciences via the training of a new generation of biochemists and immunologists with these skills. Further, this project will lead to patentable findings surrounding small molecule metabolites which will have direct implications for the biotechnology industry, where immunotherapies have the potential to treat many conditions relating to the function of the immune system. In addition to publication of results in generalist and immunology-based academic journals, the work will be disseminated to the public via media releases, social media and public lectures.",

Australia has one of the highest extinction rates in the world, and thousands more species are threatened with extinction. The United Nation’s Convention on Biological Diversity (hereafter “the Convention”), which directs and informs international efforts on threatened species, has set targets to both prevent new extinctions, and ensure the recovery of threatened species. Although Australia’s conservation policy aims to contribute towards achieving these goals, it does not currently incorporate the key indicators that are required to do so. This project proposes to develop and trial a new, integrated approach to threatened species recovery, which incorporates the approved metrics under the Convention. The development of this approach will enable Australia to meet its international obligations under the Convention. The project will work directly with government to ensure that our results are relevant to conservation managers, and likely to be integrated into policy, providing a mechanism to improve the conservation, and recovery, of Australia’s unique biota. With predictions of the continued escalation of impacts from habitat destruction, invasive species and climate change, this project aims to provide an approach that will assist in ensuring Australia’s unique native biodiversity can survive and thrive through appropriate management.",

Fatigue is pervasive, yet individuals vary widely in their response to it – some people are able to continue investing effort in spite of their fatigue, whereas others choose to rest. The neurobiological principles that govern when and why people decide to work versus rest remain poorly understood. This research will combine a novel behavioural paradigm with computational models of behaviour, pharmacological manipulations, functional neuroimaging and non-invasive brain stimulation to understand how we dynamically adapt our behaviour in response to the ebbs and flows of fatigue. Ultimately, this project will lead to a comprehensive neurobiological framework that is able to explain, predict and optimise behaviour as fatigue evolves over time.",

Continuing to work in spite of fatigue may lead to accidents, whereas too much rest may reduce efficiency. Importantly, the brain processes that guide our response to fatigue are poorly understood. This project will combine cutting-edge neuroscience tools to reveal the key brain structures and chemicals that determine how we respond to fatigue as it waxes and wanes. It will extend a partnership between neuroscience experts at Monash University and the University of Oxford, and provide an outstanding opportunity for early career researchers to engage in innovative interdisciplinary research. In particular, this project will grow capacity in a brain stimulation technique (transcranial ultrasound) that has the potential to revolutionise neuroscience research, but which is only just being adopted in Australia. The results will lead to biological models that allow us to predict when and why individuals choose to work vs rest, which will have significant implications for theoretical frameworks of fatigue. The knowledge generated from this project can be incorporated into future strategies and interventions to optimise our response to fatigue in the workplace, in the classroom, or on the sporting field. This may in turn benefit Australians economically and commercially by enhancing productivity, efficiency and learning, while minimising errors and accidents.",

New approaches to optimise skeletal muscle growth, repair and metabolism are critically required.  The lymphatic system consists of lymph vessels and nodes that play key roles in fat absorption, immune function and fluid balance. Recently, we and others have revealed new lymphatic functions in controlling fat metabolism and heart growth and repair, however, the role of the lymphatic system in skeletal muscle is currently unknown.\nUsing innovative imaging and physiological technologies, and in vitro/in vivo model systems, we aim to determine the precise location, 3D structure and functions of skeletal muscle.  We will produce new knowledge on factors secreted and transported by lymphatics with exercise or muscle damage, and how these regulate skeletal muscle growth, metabolism and repair. By identifying new lymphatic targets for nutritional therapies or modulators to combat skeletal muscle dysfunction, our outcomes will have important benefits, leading to increased participation in sport, reduced frailty, and risk of hospitalization or death. We hope to identify factors that improve meat quality and quantity (primarily skeletal muscle) yielding economic and commercial benefits.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Antimicrobial resistance has a significant socio-economic impact in Australia, posing serious challenges to health, agriculture, and the economy. Understanding how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance is crucial for addressing this pressing issue. This project focuses on investigating bacterial membranes, aiming to understand how bacteria alter their membrane composition in response to environmental changes and resist antibacterial compounds. Using cutting-edge technologies, including systems biology, and biophysical and computational tools, we will identify key factors, including genes and metabolites, involved in this process. These insights will inform the development of strategies to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes in the environment, which is crucial for preserving water and soil quality and safeguarding livestock health and food safety. Through strategic collaboration with established industry partners, our research has the potential to translate fundamental findings into commercial products. Ultimately, this project will contribute to improving environmental health and reducing economic burdens in Australia, aligning with the goals of Australia’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy 2020 & beyond.",

This project aims to decarbonise the ammonia industry through the development of a process that converts renewables to ammonia at previously unachievable energy efficiency, based on a recent breakthrough discovery of unique materials by Monash and RMIT scientists. Implementation of this innovative, fully renewables-powered process with enhanced energy efficiency will enable, currently economically unfeasible, on-site production of fertilisers by farming businesses and will remove the need for the use of fossil-fuels by large-scale ammonia producers. While creating new jobs and cutting national greenhouse gas emissions, deployment of this new technology will enable conversion of underused Australian renewables into a high-value, high-demand commodity for the national market and export, providing significant economic benefits. The project will promote adoption of the cost-effective sustainable ammonia synthesis to replace the current fossil-fuel based process through stakeholder engagement and established extensive connections to companies within the agriculture sector, fertiliser production, energy storage and distribution at all scales. This transition will reinforce national food and energy security, and will support Australia’s 2050 Net Zero objective.",

This project will bring Pacific leaders and affected communities into dialogue with Australian ethicists and international political theorists, in order to foster morally defensible policy-making and public conversation in this domain. The project will benefit Australians by guiding national policy for Pacific climate-induced immigration, and investigating how climate-displaced communities can be supported in their self-determination. It will further deliver actionable ethical guidance for Australian policymakers and citizens, communicated through policy documents for government, teaching resources for students, and media commentaries.",

Cluster randomised trials are a class of trials where entire groups (e.g. all students in a school, all community members) are allocated to receive particular interventions. These are essential when assessing the impact of interventions implemented at the group level (e.g. changes in policy, education campaigns), and are frequently conducted in Australia. However, the way these trials can be conducted is restrictive; these trials cannot easily change in response to updated information about the intervention’s effect. Further, recruiting groups can be difficult, particularly when the number of groups available to participate is limited. These issues can threaten trial validity, wasting the money and effort that Australia invests. This project will develop flexible new trial designs and statistical methodology, allowing modification of trials in response to accumulating data, and enhancing recruitment of groups. The knowledge and translational tools developed will be shared with those who plan and conduct these trials, through easy-to-use web apps and tutorials disseminated through national networks such as the Australian Clinical Trials Alliance. This will reduce costs and improve trial efficiency across application areas. This will bring benefit to Australians by allowing new interventions to be tested, leading to improved health and social outcomes.",

These receptors can recognize a diverse array of signals, including hormones, odorants, light, ions, and nutrients. We have pioneered methods to study receptors in their natural state, revealing the range of structures they adopt in response to different signals. This capability is crucial for unravelling the complexities of receptor function and addressing critical gaps in our understanding. By positioning Australia as a leader in this cutting-edge technology, we will facilitate the discovery of receptor tool compounds, benefiting Australians through advancements in scientific innovation. Insights into these structural variations will enhance our understanding of receptor models, essential for future rational drug discovery. Improved structural models have the potential to streamline the drug discovery process, minimizing costly setbacks in late-stage development. Additionally, enhanced expertise in this field will open new research and commercial opportunities, reinforcing Australia's position at the forefront of global scientific research.",

Measuring this structural disorder is critical to engineering materials with improved or entirely novel properties, but currently no technique is available that can access this information. This project is expected to provide these new methods for Australian researchers and industry to solve diverse problems and accelerate materials discovery and design. This could generate intellectual property, new materials, manufacturing and processing techniques and products for energy, health, communications, transport, and manufacturing.

In contrast to metal or enzyme catalysts they are simpler to prepare, more robust, and cheaper. However, their use has largely focused on reactions at the carbonyl group (studies which led to the 2021 Nobel prize).\nIn this proposal organocatalysts, either working alone or in tandem, are used to uncover new reactions of alkynes conjugated to the carbonyl group. The reactions targeted are all new and involve polar (2-electron) and/or radical (1-electron) bond formation, along with control of three dimensional shape (stereochemistry). The studies are focused on uncovering general reactivity patterns applicable in a range of contexts.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Society is increasingly reliant on new and sophisticated molecules to help address emerging problems ranging from health through to energy and beyond. As the molecules become increasingly complicated the challenges in their preparation grow significantly also. To address this those studying chemical synthesis must develop new reactions that provide the desired products more quickly, with greater efficiency, and with minimal waste production. By developing new reactions that exploit naturally occurring and readily recycled organic catalysts (so called organocatalysts) we have an opportunity to both access new chemical reactions and do so without the creation of excessive waste. By contributing to the discovery and deployment of such technologies Australia has the potential to create significant economic and environmental benefits.  In this proposal we will develop new chemical reactions that use either a single or pair of organocatalysts (working together) to build valuable materials from cheap and readily available building blocks. These reactions are designed to have excellent control over 3D shape, and to perform with high levels of efficiency. These innovative studies will support Australia's chemical manufacturing community by providing new strategies, and human capital, necessary for the future of this sector. The knowledge generated in this project, combined with the human capital, will help build a knowledge based Australian economy necessary for a resilient future. ",

The outcomes will be a new framework for measuring the biological determinants of cognition, and a new understanding of how age-related change in brain-body interactions contribute to cognitive change in ageing.

A fundamental problem we face in addressing the economic and social burden of age-related cognitive decline is that we do not understand the biological underpinnings of cognition. Cognition is usually considered to be related to the structure and function of the brain, but the brain does not operate in isolation from the rest of the body. The body supplies all the fuel and nutrients to drive the brain, and the effectiveness of this declines during ageing. Here, we develop a new method for understanding brain-body relationships, and how they influence cognition across the adult lifespan. The new method will position Australia at the international forefront of the next frontier in biomedical imaging: whole-body imaging. The new understanding developed during this project will be the launchpad for future research to develop interventions to help people maintain their cognitive function into old age. By understanding how cognition is linked to interactions between brain and body, this research will benefit Australians by accelerating the development of new precision interventions: tailored not only to the person, but specific organ systems within the person. The research outcomes will be communicated to the community to help people understand how maintaining their bodies - not just their brains - contributes to their cognition in their later years.",

Our proposal aims to better understand how animal cells use signalling pathways to respond to different stimuli and change their behaviour. This knowledge will be essential for understanding how organs (e.g. heart, liver, brain) grow to the right size as animals grow, and how cells are directed to perform certain specialised roles. Despite being essential for life, there is still much we do not understand about both organ growth and cell fate control. Our proposal will address these knowledge gaps, using a range of advanced microscopy technologies that will enable us to examine protein function with very high resolution. Our study will give employment and training opportunities to scientists and students in Australia, and impact research both nationally and on a global scale. For example, the knowledge we generate could have broad economic, commercial, and environmental benefits for Australians because control of organ size and cell fate are fundamental features of most species on earth (e.g. mammals and insects). In the long term, the discoveries we make could have impacts beyond academia. For example, industry could leverage the discoveries we publish to enhance certain types of food production like livestock agriculture, and our discoveries could lead to improvements in human health conditions such as growth disorders.",

Predicting which species will be able to evolve their way out of trouble, and which won’t, will be key to securing Australia’s biodiversity at a time of rapid environmental change. Genomics, the study of all the genes of an individual within and between populations and species, represents our best hope of doing so.  This project will reveal how genomic data can be used to accurately predict species’ extinction vulnerability. The outcomes will inform the use of genomic data in threatened species management. By validating the use of genomics to identify species at risk we will be better able to use targeted management, such as habitat restoration, captive breeding programs or genetic rescue to mitigate extinction risk. The project may lead to advances in the agricultural and health sectors by increasing our ability to predict pest and disease vector responses to environmental change. This work will contribute to Australia’s capacity to manage biodiversity and safeguard our environment. We will ensure these benefits come to fruition by communicating research outcomes directly to governments and biodiversity managers with whom we have direct links.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Optimisation is used extensively by Australian business to create efficient and effective plans and schedules. Solving such optimisation problems is computationally challenging, so mathematical and algorithmic innovations are required to create better solutions for increasingly complex problems. This project will use the growing power of Artificial Intelligence, and particularly Machine Learning, in this context. These techniques cannot directly solve optimisation algorithms. Instead, this project proposes to use them to augment the capability of existing algorithms which are already widely deployed in industry. The focus is on enabling better handling of complex constraints that are a characteristic of many practical scheduling and planning problems. The machine-learning based advances are expected to allow larger and more complex practical optimisation problems to be solved. To ensure that the benefits of research in this area are accessible to Australian businesses in improving their efficiency and effectiveness, the project includes an optimisation software company as a partner. Gurobi is one of the leading developers of optimisation software, which is widely used in Australia and across the world. Research outcomes will also be made publicly available in the form of both academic publications and open source software to support adoption of the innovations created in the research.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Bacteria can develop defence strategies against the antibiotics that kill them, known as antibiotic resistance mechanisms. This makes infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria hard to treat, threatening human and animal health, and costing Australia $283 billion by 2050. Alarmingly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria can share resistance mechanisms with other bacteria leading to the spread of antibiotic resistance amongst humans, animals, and the food chain. However, there is a lack of understanding on how bacteria communicate and share these mechanisms with one another. Using new technology, this project aims to study the major resistance sharing method, conjugation, which occurs when two bacterial cells come into close contact. This will allow us to better understand how conjugation is established to drive antibiotic resistance. The findings have the potential for social, economic, environmental, and commercial benefits for Australia, such as allowing humans and animals to lead healthy lives, protecting our food industry, and developing new drugs from targets identified from this project. The research outcomes will provide new knowledge towards treatments that block bacteria from sharing resistance mechanisms which will be pursued through industry collaborations. The findings can be adopted to help inform policy for Australia’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy which aims to minimise the spread of antibiotic resistance.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Magnesium, being lightweight and recyclable, holds tremendous potential for energy-efficient and environmentally friendly applications in automotive vehicles. Additionally, magnesium is bioresorbable, and its alloys are emerging as a new generation of bio-implants for bone-fixation and cardiovascular stents. However, these products often lack the necessary mechanical properties and usually need rare-earth metals, which makes them more expensive and difficult to resource, recycle, and ensure they are safe for the human body. This project aims to tackle these critical issues through the utilisation of state-of-the-art experimental and computational facilities. The expected outcomes include the development of clear rules for mixing metals to make alloys of better performance, the identification of rare-earth-free alloying additions to magnesium alloys, and the establishment of associated manufacturing processes that can significantly enhance even mechanical properties. These advancements will not only benefit the Australian magnesium industry but also contribute to the expansion of the manufacturing and bioimplants sectors to increase their international market share. The research findings will be disseminated through publications in open-access journals or repositories, as well as presentations at both national and international conferences. Additionally, this project will also seek collaboration with Australian industry partners for potential technology transfer opportunities.",

These alloys play a key role in construction, transport (cars, planes, trains), energy conversion & transmission, etc. We use these alloys because they have suitable properties: cost, strength, toughness, deformability, recyclability, durability, electrical conductivity, etc. These properties depend sensitively on the chemical elements in each alloy and the processing. The processing uses complicated thermal treatments. For example, an aluminium car body panel is first held at a temperature of 500C, cooled, pressed into the shape of the panel, slowly heated to ~200C and held. These heat treatments manipulate the way the atoms are arranged in the material and this is what controls the properties. The first stage of this atomic rearrangement is called 'nucleation' and it is not understood. This project aims to develop a new understanding of nucleation to allow better control of this atomic rearrangement process, so it can be exploited to produce higher performance metals. The potential benefits to Australia are both economic (through those producing these alloys) and environmental (through the benefits of longer lasting, stronger, more recyclable, etc, metallic materials in society). The outcomes will be translated to end users by working in collaboration directly with alloy manufacturers to integrate the new understanding into their processing.",

Hilbert’s 16th problem asks for H(n) - the maximal number of limit cycles (isolated periodic orbits) the family of 2D polynomial vector fields of degree n can display. The restricted version of this problem asks for Z(n) - the number of limit cycles that can bifurcate from a perturbation of a Hamiltonian system.\n\nThe aim of this project is to significantly improve our knowledge about the solution to Hilbert’s 16th problem and its infinitesimal version by proving upper and lower bounds for important families of planar polynomial vector fields. We will use a combination of tools from dynamical systems, validated numerics, and formal proofs to put the findings on a truly solid foundation.",

Such models are routinely used in all fields of study: finance, climate modelling, epidemiology or artificial intelligence, to name a few. Despite the ubiquity of differential equations, there are still fundamental properties of them that are not fully understood. One long-standing challenge is to understand how periodic motion can be displayed by low-dimensional differential equations. Even in the simplest setting this has not yet been settled, and it remains one of the grand challenges in mathematics. Given the recent advances in computer-assisted proofs, it is now possible to bring a modern set of mathematical techniques to bear on this problem.\n\nExpected outcomes include a better understanding of the one of the major cornerstones of mathematical modelling, which may lead to better predictive powers. The developed techniques may also be able to highlight bottlenecks in simulations, especially where accuracy is at risk. This can lead to more precise models, and therefore more efficient simulations. Australia's high-technological industries have great needs in modelling complex systems. Therefore, our proposed research may lead to improved economic and commercial benefits to the nations research intense industries.\n\nResults will be shared with relevant industries through a series of workshops, meetings, and site re-visits, allowing them to collaborate on implementation.",

Such strongly driven systems provide a new way of creating quantum materials with desirable properties, an outstanding goal in physics. Yet they remain poorly understood. The key innovation is the use of cold atomic gases, where analogues of light-driven materials can be simulated, allowing theories to be formulated and tested. Expected outcomes include the realisation and control of correlated quantum phases such as exotic superfluids. As well as advancing fields in quantum physics, this facilitates the design of tailored devices that could reduce energy consumption and the reliance on rare minerals. ",

Such quantum technologies are expected to shape the global economy and form a multibillion-dollar industry in Australia within the next decade, according to the CSIRO quantum technologies road map. However, to secure its place in this emerging global industry, it is critical for Australia to sustain and grow its investment in the latest quantum capabilities. This project promises to enhance Australia’s quantum capability since it aims to revolutionise our understanding of a new class of materials that rely on quantum effects: systems of quantum particles (atoms or electrons) under a strong driving field such as light or radio waves. This will generate new tools for transforming quantum materials with light, thus facilitating the design of tailored quantum devices that could reduce energy consumption and the reliance on rare minerals. The project takes cutting-edge theoretical expertise unique to Australia and combines it with world-class experiments that can test the theoretical predictions. The research is strongly aligned with Australia’s recently announced National Quantum Strategy, and the outcomes will be promoted beyond academia through outreach activities such as demonstrations at schools in order to foster the future quantum workforce.",

They achieve this by folding in specific 3D shapes and depending on the shape they adopt they can perform amazingly varied tasks, from chemical reactors, to molecular machines to chemical sensors. Until now our ability to understand the 3D shapes of proteins is by methods which capture a single snapshot of their 3D structure, much in the same way that a camera takes a static image. However, life at the protein level is never static and proteins constantly change shape depending on their environment and the specific biological role they are carrying out. This research plans to develop a new scientific method using cutting edge microscopy techniques that will capture ‘movies’ of the different shapes that proteins sample. This research program is akin to filming a movie scene rather than taking a photograph of the actors. This innovative project will provide a leap forward in Australian scientist’s ‘toolkit’ to study nature at the molecular level and will provide the basis for the acceleration of pharmaceutical drug design. The knowledge gained in this project will be widely disseminated by high quality scientific publications, but more broadly this new technology will be incorporated into training programs already provided by the investigators in this grant, ensuring that the Australian researchers are at the forefront of the molecular study of nature.",

The creation of new chemical synthesis knowledge to construct such building blocks is therefore essential to the development of new valuable materials. Catalysis provides a way of doing this more efficiently, minimise reagent and energy use and develop safer reaction conditions. This project aims to realise new, powerful catalytic reactivity to assemble sophisticated molecules efficiently and ultimately impact the way valuable materials are made. It will provide new patentable and indispensable catalytic methods and materials that will give Australia the cutting-edge in research capacity to gain a greater share of the global US$5.7 trillion chemicals industry market. It will address the urgent global issue of the impact of chemical manufacturing on the environment by establishing and utilising new, low-cost and sustainable solutions to making molecules. The new IP generated by the new catalytic reaction chemistry will provide the potential to leverage existing collaborations with industrial partners in fine chemicals to enable their translation and commercialisation. It will also train a new generation of highly skilled synthetic chemists with the abilities to address future scientific challenges and essential to the growth of the Australian economy.",

Anyone with pets or a farming background knows that food is one of the strongest universal behavioural rewards, and hunger or food tastiness motivates behaviour by increasing the reward value of food. Therefore, it is no surprise that hunger has provided one of the strongest evolutionary survival pressures to optimise behaviour. Yet, despite decades of behavioural research and millennia of agricultural practices showing that hunger and food reward enhances learning and motivation, we still don’t how brain circuits sensing hunger influence experience-dependent learning. This project examines how hunger and reward pathways interact to control learning.",

This project examines how brain regions that regulate appetite also simultaneously control learning. An investigation into how the brain pathways controlling appetite and food reward affect learning is important for many industries in Australia. This includes agriculture, conservation and animal welfare, as they rely on learned behaviours in changing environments. For example, after catastrophic environmental events, such as bushfires or flooding, domestic and wild animals must learn to adapt to alternative feeding strategies or sources to thrive and survive. Therefore, enhancing adaptive learning through food reward may be an important pathway to impact. The inability to adapt, or inappropriate feeding behaviour, could impact growth rates, reproductive success and long-term welfare of animals causing economic hardship and a decline in productivity to certain sectors of society. More broadly, the research will make important contributions to our fundamental understanding of how the brain computes food reward and affects decision-making processes under different environmental conditions.\n  \n",

The overarching aim of this project is to understand how the brain integrates information to guide visual attention. Visual attention is a useful behaviour for studying how brain areas communicate because brain networks must combine incoming visual information through our eyes with our internal goals and intentions. The aims of this project do not study or address any diseases. However, we know that dysfunction in communication across brain areas can have devastating consequences.  Many brain disorders - from Alzheimers to Autism, have symptoms affecting cognitive behaviours including attention, decision-making and memory. Understanding how healthy brains support cognition will give us insight into why this occurs.

Our population is ageing, as is its workforce, and coupled with falling birth rates this impacts economic productivity. In agriculture, the productive lifespan of livestock or crops falls many years short of their natural lifespan. We address this challenge by investigating a critical biological question – what makes us age well and productively? We focus on autophagy, the “garbage disposal” system inside cells that fails as we age. Preserved across a billion years of evolution from plants to humans, we are yet to harness its anti-ageing benefits. Our interdisciplinary approach integrates advanced microscopy (unique to us) with studies in animal models, to build a “molecular map” of components that sustain autophagy, and track their effect on ageing in real time. To deliver meaningful socioeconomic benefits we focus on muscle as the discovery of factors that sustain mobility are key to productivity. By revealing the molecular components involved, we may also provide long-term economic/environmental benefits in building strategies to monitor or prolong agricultural longevity. This is ideal for maximising food production within a limited environmental footprint.

This project aims to define the molecular mechanisms that govern the protein and lipid composition of a largely ignored cell surface organelle named cilia, found in species from worms to mammals, which is essential for organ development. New knowledge will be generated using a multidisciplinary approach available in few laboratories worldwide, combining high-end imaging of proteins and lipids, proteomics and lipidomics of cilia. Expected outcomes include the first total proteome map of an entire organelle with altered lipid signals. Significant benefits include interdisciplinary training for students and enhanced national/international collaborations that will enable new technology generation, to answer previously unapproachable questions.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Primary cilia are hair-like microscopic projections on cells found in all animal species. They transmit messages within cells, which is essential for the formation of all organs and structures in the developing embryo. Defects in cilia result in devastating developmental abnormalities in organs such as brain, kidney and lungs. Cilia also contribute to the maintenance of good health by regulating metabolism and ageing. How these tiny structures regulate such important biological processes remains an unresolved scientific question. Our internationally recognised team will apply the latest advanced technologies to understand the role of cilia in organ development, and thereby how severe inherited malformations of mammals, fish and other species arise. Therefore, study of cilia will answer fundamental biology questions on a vital but understudied cell component. This work will strengthen existing international collaborations and initiate new partnerships with world leading scientists, bringing new scientific skills to Australia. Development of advanced scientific tools including cutting-edge microscopy and computing technologies is of national importance in training the next generation of scientists to support the sovereign capabilities of Australia’s growing biotechnology sector. Beyond academic publication and scientific meetings, our results will be communicated through Monash University’s strong profile in traditional and social media platforms and in public lecture series.",

    "summary": "Understanding how neural circuit activity is controlled by adenosine. The aim of this project is to understand how adenosine regulates neural circuit activity in spinal networks. Adenosine is a building block of life and essential for energy metabolism, but also functions as a signalling molecule. In this role, it has been studied extensively in the heart, but there has been less focus on neuronal signalling in sensory pathways. This project will focus on adenosine A1-receptor signalling to address this gap in the field by revealing the source of adenosine in this region, the effects of A1 receptor activation from the level of a single neuron, up to the network of sensory neurons regulated by adenosine. Lastly, we will develop new tools that can be used to understand adenosine signalling in multiple systems.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The nervous system serves as the body's command center, coordinating activities and ensuring proper responses to the external environment. To facilitate seamless communication through the nervous system, we employ a nerve modulator called ‘adenosine’, which plays important roles in controlling activity in the brain and spinal cord. This project seeks to understand how adenosine modulates sensory signals (eg: temperature, pain and touch) as they are transmitted through the nervous system. While we know adenosine regulates incoming signals, the intricacies of how and where remain unclear. The insights gained may hold the key to developing treatments for conditions like chronic pain or spinal injuries, improving lives of millions of Australians. Beyond health, effectively targeting this system could yield economic benefits by allowing more people to return to work, fostering a healthier and happier society. \nIn the short term, this project will provide Australian scientists with new pharmacological tools to explore adenosines roles in the nervous system and other vital organs. To ensure future research adoption, findings will be published in open-access general journals, reaching both the scientific community and the public. Conferences will be a platform for sharing results, and all tools and knowledge will be freely accessible. The broader public will be engaged through news releases and interviews, maximizing understanding and translation of these discoveries beyond academia.",

Silicon based AI is now ubiquitous but is encumbered by increasing energy use and is slow to learn, particularly when given incomplete information. In contrast, the human brain, the most sophisticated computer, is energy efficient and highly adaptable in learning and computing across a range of datasets. We will demonstrate the ability of our living AI device to undertake learning tasks and the outcomes will lay the foundation and design rules for biological neural networks integrated with computers. This will result in the formation of new AI technologies which are more energy efficient and powerful than existing AI platforms. The project has the potential to propel Australia to the forefront of a new branch of neural computing, generating new industries, employing highly skilled local workforce and building critical resilience in key national priorities such as advanced manufacturing. Patent protection of IP will accelerate links with commercial partners, and our results will be communicated by team members at local and international conferences to disseminate results to identify applications for our technology.",

This project will define the DNA repair capacity of granulosa cells in primordial follicles, compared to growing follicles, in the context of exogenous and endogenous DNA damage. Longevity, combined with the arrested state of their chromosomes render oocytes and their supporting granulosa cells in primordial follicles vulnerable to DNA damage. As oocytes are irreplaceable, to ensure fertility and health of the future generations it is imperative that the health of these primordial follicles is maintained throughout reproductive life. This discovery research will generate entirely new knowledge regarding the mechanisms underpinning oocyte quality, with implications for improving mammalian female fertility.",

As such, defective granulosa cell proliferation and function can cause infertility and hormone deficiency, leading to range of negative outcomes including impaired growth and development in animals. Granulosa cells are unique and cannot be replaced by any other cell types, but surprisingly little is known about their essential properties or how their functional integrity is maintained. This project expects to expand our knowledge of how granulosa cells use DNA repair to maintain function over their prolonged lifespan. It will also determine the importance of these processes for fertility and endocrine function. These advancements are essential for development of new assisted reproductive technologies, which can improve agricultural breeding practices and support conservation projects for endangered animals. Additionally, this work will foster international collaborations and train young Australian researchers in cutting-edge techniques to expand Australia’s capacity and capability in this crucial area of reproductive biology research. Beyond the scientific community, the outcomes of this research will be shared with the broader public through social media platforms and various media outlets. The Monash public relations office, committed to aiding the communication of research findings, will support these dissemination efforts.",

Malaria is a major global health and socio-economic burden, impacting over 200 million people every year, including many of Australia’s neighbours, tourist destinations and military and economic partners. By better understanding how these parasites divide and spread within and between hosts, we expect to identify new molecular mechanisms that could underpin future research to control parasite transmission. Closely related parasites, that use similar mechanisms to replicate, infect animals that impact Australian agriculture and wildlife; our research may identify new control methods for these parasites too.\nThis project is enabled by our technological breakthrough that allows us to study the way proteins interact in living cells in real time. This project will develop Australia’s capability to implement this new technology so that it can be applied to other biological questions of agricultural, environmental and human health importance. We will promote this new technology to our national and international collaborators through publications and presentations, and promote our findings on cellular replication to the public through media and education outreach events organised by the Australian Society for Parasitology. \n",

New S. cerevisiae strains of various functionalities are commonly generated through the introduction of new genes, called \"transgenes\". Transgenes must become active only at the right time in the case of many biotech applications. Yet, S cerevisiae cannot turn off many genes simultaneously and pack them until they are needed to become active again. This is a major bottleneck for the development of advanced biotechnology applications using S cerevisiae.\n\nThis project aims to generate the first S cerevisiae strains that are capable of packing silenced genes using the same factors that human cells are utilising. By doing so, this project will enable the application of fast and robust yeast genetic approaches for the study of human-gene silencing processes that are otherwise too complicated to study in human cells. The project will strengthen the high reputation of Australia in genetics and transcriptional regulation. This project also aims to allow, for the first time, the engineering of yeast strains with a gene expression control similar to that of multicellular organisms. The usage of these new traits for the generation of genetically modified yeast lines will transform the biotech sector by enabling the engineering of complex pathways in yeast to revolutionise their applicability.",

Central to rectifying these disparities are teachers, who are pivotal in shaping students' life trajectories and formulating their human capital. However, there are significant gaps in this research space that make it difficult to understand and predict how teachers' attitudes, behaviours, and potential biases influence these gaps, impacting students' motivation, effort, and pathways. With significant gender gaps in Australia, better policies are needed to improve students' long-run outcomes and motivate girls to apply to prestigious STEM degrees and occupations. This project will develop new methodologies and test their applications to understand to what extent teachers’ attitudes and behaviours influence the gender gap in STEM studies and careers. The expected outcome and benefit of this project is to inform and design policies to improve long-run outcomes of students, eliminate barriers for women's participation in STEM and reduce the gender wage gap. The translation pathway includes formal submissions to government authorities dealing with the issues of gender and education, media engagement, and stakeholder forums to disseminate research outcomes to a policy audience. The potential future benefits of using these methodologies to support the changes required to address gender gaps in Australia and globally are immense.",

The overall goal is to study the changes in these estimates as the equation coefficients, indicative of factors like the roughness of the medium, become increasingly singular, through investigating a longstanding conjecture of Pucci from 1966. Anticipated outcomes encompass the invention of a new class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations, along with new harmonic analysis techniques for studying them. The results will be a significant milestone for partial differential equations and solidify Australia's leadership in this cornerstone of modern mathematics.",

Our previous work has found applications in differential geometry, computational mathematics, optimal transport and more recently in geometric optics. They provided new models for optical systems, which direct given light sources onto desired targets. The current project seeks to establish a good quantitative understanding of solutions to some of the most fundamental types of PDEs. It innovates by constructing a new mathematical object that captures symmetrically the contributions to curvature from different directions, a framework commonly used for expressing image processing operators in computer vision. The project further addresses a longstanding open problem about PDEs, whose study is pioneered by Australian mathematicians. By putting together novel ideas from different areas of mathematics, the project seeks to deliver deep results, and ensure that Australia remains at the cutting edge of the mathematical developments that will underpin the next generation of technological advances, such as communication technologies, medical imaging and mineral exploration. It will also foster international collaboration, via in-depth discussions with experts across the world, and build up Australia's capacity in quantitative skills by training postdoctoral researchers and HDR students. Lectures aimed at general audiences will be given to promote understanding and maximize use of our discoveries. ",

This project aims to better constrain future rates of sea level rise from Antarctic ice melt by developing new fundamental understanding of the complex ocean processes that drive melting and by transforming the representation of ocean–ice shelf interactions in Australia’s next-generation global ocean model.

Over 85% of the Australian population currently live within the coastal zone susceptible to sea level rise and $226 billion in Australian infrastructure assets are at risk of inundation and erosion hazards by 2100. Yet projections of Antarctic ice loss are highly uncertain and more accurate projections of sea level rise are needed for future coastal adaptation. This project will improve projections of future rates of sea level rise stemming from Antarctic ice melt by developing new fundamental understanding of the complex ocean processes that drive melting. New ocean modelling capability will be developed that represents the fine-scale ocean processes that bring warm ocean waters into contact with the Antarctic ice sheet and drive melt. This new modelling capability will have broad use by researchers in the national and international climate science community. The research will support Australia to be better prepared for future sea level rise and help to guide future climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, thus enhancing the resilience of our economy, society, and natural environment. The increased accuracy of sea level projections enabled by this project will also inform insurance and financial risk projections and guide coastal planning policy across all levels of government.",

A genetic process where certain traits are more likely to be passed on, called gene drives, can be used to prevent animals from producing offspring, and has enormous potential for non-lethal, large-scale suppression of invasive populations. Gene drives have so far been challenging to develop in mammals. This project investigates naturally occurring mouse gene drives and uses them to generate a man-made gene drive. Importantly, the gene drive developed in this project could be used in other mammalian pest species. The technology developed in this project could transform Australia’s environment and biodiversity, especially for island conservation, where mammalian pests are most destructive. Australia’s agricultural industry is also heavily impacted by invasive pests, including widespread mouse plagues, and will benefit from cost-effective and humane solutions to pest management. The knowledge and tools generated in this project will be shared through the research team’s active involvement in international invasive rodent associations, including with leading experts, not-for-profits, and Australian and overseas government agencies. Gene drive developments will also be shared with various stakeholders and the public by media communications and the South Australian Genetic Biocontrol program.",

Smart switchable materials have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in drug delivery, smart coatings, and soft robotics. However, rational design of self-assembled supramolecular systems that undergo controlled switching is inhibited by a lack of understanding as to the fundamental mechanisms controlling these dynamic processes. This project will use cutting-edge ion mobility mass spectrometry technologies to gain new insights into controlling switchable processes in supramolecular materials stimulated by light, heat, or electricity. By monitoring these processes in real-time, we will have a window through which we can develop greater understanding of switching mechanisms for future functional materials.",

This project therefore focuses on increasing code quality and safeguarding the future of Australia's critical digital infrastructure by creating a framework to make AI-generated code more correct and secure, and AI models more robust.\n\nIncreasing the quality of automatically generated code will better protect Australian businesses against cyberthreats, creating significant short- and long-term social and economic benefits. It will also increase business and consumer confidence in software built using this code, leading to greater adoption of the technology, with associated commercial advantages. Additionally, our project will promote innovation and expertise in code language model technology, advancing software engineering research in Australia. \n\nTo ensure software engineers understand and adopt our framework, we will make the tools and techniques we develop open-source, sharing them freely with Australian businesses, policymakers and researchers. We will also communicate our results widely by giving keynotes and talks at international conferences and workshops, and showcasing our results online and through industry presentations.",

With an increasing number of global ethnic-religious conflicts, racism is on the rise in Australia where racial hate speech has become an epidemic. Racism is estimated to cost Australia between $21.1 and $54.7 billion annually due to its significant psychological, cultural, and economic impacts. However, current racism reduction tools are insufficiently engaging and sensory poor, and we urgently need effective and scalable intervention tools. This project is designed to meet this critical need. By harnessing technological advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence, this project will create interactions with highly realistic digital humans called ‘high fidelity mixed reality’ (hfMR) to discover how negative intergroup racial dynamics can improve via optimal contact and identity-transformation embodiment. A significant outcome will be effective racism-reducing hfMR toolkits for researchers, stakeholders, and policy makers to implement, facilitating impactful racism reduction. Importantly, this project will respond to the Government’s (2022) $7.5MIL commitment to a national anti-racism strategy by providing viable strategies to combat race hate speech. At a public level, outcomes will be shared amongst relevant national (Australian Human Rights Commission) and international (UK Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities) agencies.",

We will address this critical gap in our knowledge by examining what happens in the brain during impulsive behaviours. Using cutting-edge tools in neuroscience, this project will identify what happens when we make poor choices and investigate the brain circuits involved. Fundamental knowledge about impulsive actions will build on current theories of how we make decisions and identify factors involved in poor decision-making.

    "summary": "Capturing elusive bionanoparticles via oscillating field induced convection. Capturing tiny bioparticles at low concentrations within biofluids poses a major challenge for broad bioanalysis applications. The project aims to develop a novel sample preparation method that enhances bioparticle capture and isolation processes. This method will prevent unwanted biomolecules from adhering to surfaces and enable selective target capture, thus improving detection specificity and sensitivity. This will be achieved using convective fluid motion, a recently discovered phenomenon triggered by an oscillating magnetic field. The outcomes will enable efficient isolation and detection of a wide range of biomolecules in biomedical, agricultural and environmental applications, resulting in significant economic benefits for Australia.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Current portable biosensing devices, such as the COVID-19 RAT, face two longstanding challenges: i) false positive responses due to non-specific biomolecule detection; and ii) low signal response resulting from insufficient detection sensitivity. These biosensing issues are usually compounded by more complex biofluids, such as blood, which contain numerous non-target molecules. Currently, there are no comprehensive solutions for sample handling in these devices. This project aims to establish a novel biofluid handling method that enables biosensing devices to eliminate false positive responses and boost detection sensitivity of biomolecules. The project utilizes the tunability of alternating current (AC) electric field-induced fluid flow to enable the transport, manipulation, and analysis of biomolecules at the microscale. The outcomes will enable the practical implementation of portable biosensing devices to detect various disease-specific biomolecules early, with greater sensitivity, specificity, and speed.\nAccurate, early, and rapid detection of various chronic diseases will significantly reduce Australia’s healthcare costs. This innovative interdisciplinary approach will push the boundaries of existing devices and provide a single platform for rapid point-of-care (POC) biosensing and translation via small-scale manufacturing. The outcome will solidify Australia's position as a world leader in the design, manufacture, and commercialization of portable biosensing devices.",

We aim to demonstrate experimentally that lifestyle activities known to improve cognitive functioning, act by improving the brain’s vascular health.\n\nThe outcomes will produce evidence for a direct mechanism linking variability in the brain’s vascular system, brain structure and function, and cognitive ability in healthy older adults. \n\nThis work may have significant economic, social and cultural benefits by supporting healthy and engaged ageing, prolonging social and economic participation, and reducing reliance on healthcare resources. It will also build the capacity of young Australian researchers in healthy ageing research.\n\nImplications for healthy ageing will be disseminated through the Hunter Medical Research Institute to national and international peak bodies, state and federal government bodies, industry and community to increase knowledge and support translation in program development.

By utilising computer simulations to model the physics of the infant universe and how this will manifest in Square Kilometre Array data, this program will deliver unprecedented insights into how properties of stars transform galaxies over time, shedding light on one of the oldest and most basic questions asked by humanity since the beginning of time: \"where did we come from?\". The answers we obtain will be of broad interest to the public, and the process of obtaining them will equip fundamental research techniques that will prepare students for careers in a wide range of private- and public-sector professions that rely on technical skills where demand is high, such as data science, financial modelling, and aerospace and defence applications.  The project will also build on Australia's traditional strength in astronomical sciences, and help the country play a more prominent role in a number of major international scientific collaborations. This will ensure that Australia has world-leading technical expertise that is crucial for our future economic growth.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Offshore wind farms, where power generation is more reliable and consistent, are globally considered a key solution for renewable energy. Up to now, the global offshore wind industry has developed rapidly in shallow waters with fixed-bottom turbines. Yet further offshore in water depths exceeding 60m winds are stronger and even more consistent. Here, floating wind turbines (FWTs) have technical and economic advantages over fixed-bottom solutions due to their greater size and capacity. However, key to the success of FWTs is an effective mooring system, which currently costs ~35% of the overall investment. Comprising mooring lines and embedded anchors, mooring systems must be advanced, especially for deployment onto Australian seabeds that have problematic carbonate soil and harsh environments. This project will deliver scientific knowledge and engineering solutions to support mooring systems for offshore FWTs in Australian waters. We will share our research findings with industry networks to accelerate adoption and report them publicly through media articles. It will have economic, environmental, and social benefits for Australia. New renewable energy projects provide commercial income, create local jobs, and bolster domestic electricity supply, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. FWTs will increase Australia’s renewable energy supply providing access to reliable, secure, and affordable energy as well as supporting our ambitious goal to reach net zero by 2050.",

We will use state-of-the-art molecular and cellular approaches to discover mechanisms that control Gasdermins to manage cell death response.

Each day, billions of cells die off as a part of normal cell turnover. One form of cell death is pyroptosis, which acts as a front-line host defence mechanism. This project focuses on understanding the regulation of Gasdermin proteins (Gsdms) that are essential to execute pyroptosis. However the cell specific function of Gsdms, their stability and how they shift pyroptosis to other types of cell death remain unknown. This project aims to fill the current gap in knowledge and elucidate the machinery that controls Gsdm levels and activity to manage different modes of cell death. Understanding these mechanisms will generate new knowledge and contribute significantly to this highly topical research field. Research outcomes will help build Australia's research capability with the potential to generate high-impact knowledge across various fields, such as cell biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Pyroptosis is associated with many inflammatory conditions that pose a huge economic burden on the nation. The fundamental knowledge gained from the project can be applied in the biotechnology industry in the future to develop tools for animal and public health, thus bringing significant economic and social benefits to Australia.",

Attending to epistemic devices mobilised by these groups, we map complex institutional ecologies arising in the management of Australian waters across scale (creek, river, river basin). We also work collaboratively to identify new synergies, efficiencies, and competencies that may be more actively engaged within organisations, across sites, and within management policies and procedures. Outcomes of the project will include evidence of new ways of collaborating around, agreeing upon, and caring for watery places and their futures as central actors in Australian collective life. Our involvements in state, territory, and federal government depts – through the delivery of public service treaty education (VIC), the practices and evaluation of Local Decision Making policies (NT) and the work of the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (Australian Govt) – ensures the potential for positive recognition and uptake of project resources and insights beyond the life of the funding.",

Importantly, it is crucial for proteases to be strictly regulated to avoid unwilling proteolysis. This proposal investigates a molecular clock to turn off protease activity. This proposal seeks to reveal how substrate availability acts as a signal inhibition to control the magnitude of proteolysis. Expected outcomes include new insights into regulating protease activity and how their own substrates control the duration and magnitude of proteolysis. Project benefits include a fundamental understanding of how proteolytic processes are strictly regulated and shut down to control the amplification of molecular signals.",

Despite this significance there is a substantial gap in understanding why it initially formed ~34 million years ago, and what has since caused it to advance and retreat. This project aims to fill this gap by exploring the impact of mantle convection – the internal ‘engine’ driving our dynamic planet – on AIS inception and evolution. Observational constraints on mantle structure and dynamics will be merged with state-of-the-art computational models, to improve understanding of the processes that have operated beneath Antarctica’s surface and their influence on the AIS. The project will advance Australia’s leadership in Antarctic Science, over which Australia has 42% sovereignty, and train future geoscientists crucial for Australia’s economy. Expected outcomes include: 1) enhanced environmental knowledge of Antarctica, specifically the likely response of the AIS to global warming; and 2) better calibrated models of ice-sheet behaviour, for improved future sea-level forecasts. These will contribute to Australia’s economic and commercial prosperity (e.g. assessing future sea port viability) and social and cultural well-being (e.g. predicting regional coastal migration patterns). Results will be widely disseminated, including through existing partnerships with Geoscience Australia and the Australian Centre of Excellence for Antarctic Science.",

This project seeks to innovate plant-based protein texturization by developing a dual emulsion gel system with pea protein, as an alternative to extrusion. The approach can be tailored to create properties that closely replicate the sensory and mechanical properties of animal-derived foods, and allows encapsulation of micronutrients that are often lacking in plant-based products. Successful outcomes will expand the utilisation of plant proteins beyond those commonly found in extruded products, and contribute to the growth of Australia's plant protein market, projected to reach $13 billion by 2030.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Up to 10% of the global meat market could be captured by plant-based products to replace animal foods such as meat and fish, with an estimated total market value of US$85 billion by 2030. A major challenge in generating these products is to mimic the sensory qualities (e.g. mouthfeel, springiness, chewiness) of animal foods. The high temperatures and pressures used in current manufacturing processes do not mimic these effects well, and often result in nutrient loss.\n\nThis project will develop a new gelling technology to create desirable qualities without excessive heat treatment, while also protecting nutrients and allowing use of diverse plant proteins beyond the commonly used soy and wheat proteins. The method could lead to new solutions in plant-based food manufacturing as it can be directly integrated into current processes.\n\nThe project aligns with Australian Government priorities in food research and production. Rapidly growing demand for plant foods due to health benefits, sustainability and mitigating environmental damage sees Australia investing heavily in plant-food manufacturing. If these innovations are adopted by industry – as evidenced by the team’s current collaboration with large companies and start-ups – they will increase Australia's capabilities in advanced food manufacturing, including in regional areas. Ultimately this increases opportunities for employment and value-added exports, while delivering more nutritious, healthier and sustainable foods.\n\n",

Through a combination of our state-of-the-art atomic calculations for atoms, hydrogen-like ions, and exotic muonic atoms (where an electron is replaced by a much heavier muon) and high-precision experiments, we will deduce new information about nuclear properties and their distribution. These insights will enable a breakthrough in the modelling of nuclear effects in atomic systems, and allow searches for “fifth” forces, dark matter candidates, and other particles that lie beyond the Standard Model of particle physics to advance to a new level of precision. Improved knowledge about nuclei and implementation in high-precision atomic calculations will have applications in areas such as atomic clocks for precision timing, positioning, and navigation. This project will strengthen ties to scientists at world-leading laboratories and universities, including Max-Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, Germany, and will elevate Australia’s standing in the international atomic, nuclear, and particle physics communities.

We will promote heritage methods and concepts that work in cross-cultural collaborations to inform and improve Australia’s international heritage initiatives through publicly available protocols. Undertaking this research addresses an ongoing colonial injustice, builds goodwill towards Australia, fosters international research collaboration between the two countries and generates engagement opportunities.

We propose to extract cheaper plant-based urease enzymes from an Australian weed, Paddy melon seeds, and develop their kinetics framework for calcium carbonate precipitation for binding and stabilising tailings, by-products of the mining operation. It significantly reduces the cost of cementation and will be a sustainable alternative to cement and other chemical additives with a very high carbon footprint. This novel approach will stabilise tailings storage facilities (TSFs) surface/capping upon ceasing mining operations. A constitutive and user-defined model for numerical software will be developed to ensure faster and greener technology transfer in mining closer activities, which currently is the largest industry for the national GDP.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Mining contributes nearly one-tenth of Australia’s gross domestic product. However, mining creates by-products called tailings, typically stored in large dams called tailings storage facilities (TSFs). When mining operations end, TSFs are decommissioned to prevent tailings from contaminating the environment. There are 759 inactive TSFs in Australia and approximately 30,000 worldwide. Due to the legacy of tailings operations and poor quality of closure materials, many TSF surface tailings require stabilisation to ensure their integrity and reduce costs. While calcium-based stabilisers like lime and cement are sometimes used to mix and compact with soils to bind soil particles for stability, they are unsuitable for tailings. To address this gap, the project will repurpose one of Australia's most invasive common weeds, prickly paddy melons, to engineer weed-based enzyme extracts to bind and stabilise soil and tailing particles. This innovative approach is more effective and sustainable than traditional binders, and cheaper, with the added benefit that removing these weeds positively impacts farming systems, biodiversity, and grazing livestock. The project will also develop models and engineering tools for stabilised tailings. To ensure faster and greener technology transfer in mining activities, outcomes will be disseminated to industry and government via meetings, workshops, articles, conferences, media releases, a project website, and seminars aimed at the general public.",

New knowledge about this type of agreement-making will be created by investigating cases from Western Australia and Victoria where settlement agreements have been established under two separate legislative instruments; the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) and the Traditional Owner Settlement Act 2010 (Vic). The findings promise to provide new conceptual and theoretical arguments about settlement agreements in respect to Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination, while providing valuable insights into the factors which underpin their negotiation, implementation and management.",

The Settlement Agreements negotiated by Victoria and Western Australia constitute one possible avenue to reconciliation and Indigenous advancement, given that they address matters related to native title, land management, governance, economic advancement, and protection of culture and Country. This project seeks to generate new knowledge regarding Settlement Agreements, and to assess their potential value in improving relationships between First Peoples and the Australian state and advancing the interests of Indigenous Australians. It will do this by focusing on the negotiation, implementation and outcomes of all seven Settlement Agreements concluded in Victoria and Western Australia since 2010. It will focus on the potential and the realised benefits of Agreements for the First Peoples involved, using an innovative methodology designed to assess outcomes in key areas including self-determination, protection of country, economic opportunity, and cultural and social advancement. Findings will be communicated directly with participant groups during the project, through the Agreements, Treaties and Negotiated Settlements (ATNS) website and at the AIATSIS Summit where we will hold a workshop and disseminate knowledge to policy-makers, researchers, native title groups and First Peoples. \n",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Intimate partner financial abuse is a red flag for domestic violence (DV). It occurs in nearly all DV cases, impacts over 2.4M Australians, and costs the national economy over $10.9B annually. Perpetrators can currently use business structures to create tax debts in the victim-survivor's name. This gives rise to the perverse outcome of victim-survivors being held responsible for perpetrators’ debts, with the Australian Taxation Office unwittingly being mobilised against them using payment plans, debt collectors and bankruptcy. In contrast, ‘innocent spouse relief’ provisions in the United States offer relief on grounds of financial abuse. Leveraging participatory action research methods and collaborating with US researchers, this interdisciplinary project aims to address current legal, regulatory and administrative shortcomings by comprehensively mapping the abuses of the tax system by perpetrators, and designing tax law and policy responses to identify and support victim-survivors while also disrupting perpetrators. To maximise knowledge translation and practical outcomes, results will be shared through government and policymaker meetings, community organisations, industry networks, conferences, articles and media channels. The new knowledge generated by addressing this critical gap has significant policy and practical relevance, strengthening the federal response to DV and modernising tax law and administration by combatting the weaponisation of the tax system in Australia.",

This project aims to fill a critical knowledge gap in how unique chloroplasts function beyond photosynthesis across four major cell types of a plant leaf, enabling plants to sense and respond to environmental changes. It aims to dissect how different chloroplasts utilise hydrogen peroxide, a key messenger molecule, in these specialised cells to modulate acclimation to stressful conditions such as excess sunlight. Expected outcomes include an unprecedented, cellular-resolution blueprint of a leaf showing how chloroplast- and cell type-specialisation are coordinated for plant growth and survival. This should provide significant benefits to the engineering of improved climate resilience into key Australian crops including canola and sorghum.",

Climate extremes negatively impact crop yields, specifically grains and oilseed, which are down by 87% and are estimated to diminish our GDP by $5.5 billion annually. Traditional strategies to enhance crop resilience often target the entire plant, however, this often results in trade-offs with undesirable impacts on plant growth and seed yield. Greater precision in our strategies is needed to avoid the trade-offs and inform future crop breeding that enhances both crop and economic resilience. This project seeks to discover and understand the specialised roles of diverse plant leaf cells in sensing changes to their environment, such as extended drought and intense sunlight. By deepening our understanding of the cellular and molecular specialisation within the plant leaf, we can leverage the discoveries and insights to guide Australian crop breeders and global agri-technology companies to produce next-generation climate-resilient crops with fewer trade-offs. Collectively, this research contributes to strategies that aim to safeguard the rural Australian agriculture industry and food security against environmental threats from climate change.",

This project aims to study the molecular mechanisms of the mitochondrial replisome, the machinery that copies mitochondrial DNA. While DNA replication in the cell nucleus has been extensively studied for decades, processes that define mitochondrial DNA replication are poorly understood. This interdisciplinary effort will merge cutting-edge cryo-EM with novel single-molecule biophysical tools to establish the architecture of human mitochondrial replication and define how it coordinates synthesis of the two DNA strands. Expected outcomes of this project include a high-resolution understanding of a fundamental biological process, development of novel biophysical methodology, and training of the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists.",

This project will delve into the core mechanisms of the copying of human mitochondrial DNA. By employing advanced electron and light microscopy techniques, we aim to reveal the structures and dynamic activities of the proteins that copy mitochondrial DNA on their native DNA substrates. This research will deepen our fundamental understanding of mitochondrial biology. The resulting biochemical reagents and novel imaging methods will be useful to biotechnological research and anyone studying chromosome biology at the molecular level. Additionally, the findings from this project could open new avenues for exploring how cellular energy metabolism is linked to maintaining broader biological functions in aging. The project will also provide outstanding multidisciplinary training opportunities for Australian researchers and strengthen Australia’s capabilities in the cutting-edge fields of biophysics and electron microscopy.",

This project examines the function of proxy advisors and their ability to direct capital investment to encourage ethical and sustainable business practices. By elucidating the complex relationships among proxy advisors, investors, social movements, and corporations, we aim to create a better understanding of efforts to align investment decisions with broader societal goals and major public issues in Australia. The project specifically focuses on climate change, modern slavery, and First Nation People's land and cultural rights, which are critical issues that carry national, regional, and global significance. Gaining such insights is valuable for the general public as well as for policy making, as better understanding the role of proxy advisors increases transparency and accountability around investment decisions, which can in turn inform public and company policy that considers the social and environmental consequences of investment decisions alongside wealth creation. Project outcomes will not only be disseminated in the academic community, but also presented to non-academic audiences in accessible formats. This dissemination strategy maximises engagement with the insights on the role of proxy advisors in aligning investment decisions with communal interests, bringing the benefits of our research into public discourse.",

Our research seeks to confront these challenges by uncovering the negative impact of virtual influencers on Gen Z, especially in underrepresented groups such as Indigenous Australians and LGBTQ+ communities. Guided by an advisory committee to ensure alignment with Indigenous community values and needs, we also assess the effectiveness of incorporating inclusion and diversity cues, such as the portrayal of minority groups, in virtual influencers, to promote healthier self-perceptions amongst the 15 to 24 age group. This research will assist firms in developing inclusive marketing strategies that appeal to Gen Z's preference for socially responsible brands and will set new media standards, fostering a positive culture for Gen Z and marginalised groups. The findings will guide the development of advertising regulations preventing influencers from promoting unrealistic body ideals. Our research will be disseminated via various channels in Australia and the US. Development of a Virtual Influencer Directory, Interactive Tool, and guidelines on diversity and inclusion will aid policymakers and businesses in making informed decisions about the ethical use and governance of virtual influencers.",

Triggering behaviour change can benefit individuals (e.g., healthy eating), communities (e.g., protection via vaccination) and humanity as a whole (e.g., emission reduction via electricity saving). Yet the mechanisms by which behaviour change can be triggered are not yet fully understood because the effect of an intervention on latent theoretical constructs (intervention effect) is not routinely isolated from the effect of the construct change on the behaviour (construct effect). This project aims to develop a new theory of behaviour change that disentangles these two aspects (thus elucidating the mechanism), validate it empirically, and compare its performance with current approaches in the context of climate change mitigation behaviour.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project aims to develop and validate a new theory to guide the swift design of practical measures that entice people to change their behaviour. Being able to change people's behaviour is critical across many domains, including population health (e.g., mask-wearing) and climate change mitigation (e.g., energy saving). Existing theories are limited in their ability to offer practical guidance for the swift design of behaviour change measures because they do not pinpoint the exact mechanisms that lead to behaviour change. This project aims to develop Mechanisms of Behaviour Change Theory (MeBeC), which simultaneously tests how effective different types of measures are in triggering behaviour change and which mechanisms are responsible for causing this change. In so doing, MeBeC can identify the most promising combinations of practical measures and theoretical constructs to target, thus speeding up the future design of effective behaviour change measures. MeBeC will contribute new knowledge to the behavioural sciences, while also benefitting Australia by enabling policy makers and businesses to swiftly develop effective behaviour change measures to address key environmental and social challenges. MeBeC and all newly developed behaviour change measures targeting two specific climate change mitigation behaviours will be shared with the scientific community, industry, and the public (YouTube videos, social media posts, The Conversation, press releases) to maximise impact.",

The project is designed to generate new understanding of the evolution of cellular complexity using the phylum as a model. In addition, the program aims to provide a comprehensive characterisation of the Planctomycetota, which has recently expanded from three of 28 classes due to recovery of genomes from the environment.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Planctomycetes are distinctive bacteria found globally in soil and aquatic environments that play important roles in carbon and nitrogen cycling including removal of ammonium from wastewater via a unique process. In Australia, they are found in iconic habitats including sponges on the Great Barrier Reef and in koalas and prawns. Planctomycetes have many cellular features that are not found in other bacteria, and instead resemble those found in animal and plant cells. Despite their wide distribution and significance in natural and engineered systems, our current knowledge of the group is restricted because they are difficult to grow in the laboratory, limiting our understanding of their functions and the origin of their unusual cellular features. Through DNA sequencing of Australian habitats, this project aims to address these knowledge gaps by producing new planctomycete genomes, identifying and characterising genes responsible for cell structure in the group, and determining the relationship of these structures to plant and animal cells. This new knowledge will improve our understanding of Australian biodiversity and has the potential to benefit the Australian economy through discovery of novel functions relevant to industries such as agriculture, aquaculture and mining and contribute to the management of our ecosystems.",

Expected outcomes include the first detailed maps of the routes that migrating honeyeaters take and actionable data on how habitat features influence the ecosystem services that these keystone pollinators provide.

In Australia, many migrants play a critical role in ensuring the health and resilience of agricultural and natural ecosystems as pollinators for flowering plants. However, current understanding of the movements of migratory birds in Australia is decades behind the global standard. This project combines cost-effective and cutting-edge technologies to close this gap and establish a new standard for wildlife monitoring in Australia. Tracking migratory pollinators as they move in and between different habitats will reveal—for the first time—the complete migratory paths of any honeyeater species and the features shaping where they go and when. The project will generate novel insights into avian biology and deliver specific outputs to key stakeholders (Greening Australia and conservation efforts for Australia’s most endangered bird—the regent honeyeater). Further, the project will integrate with, and expand, Australia’s Internet of Things capacity that is underpinning multibillion dollar developments in the agricultural sector. In doing so, the project will develop tools that can incorporate biodiversity monitoring with ‘smart agriculture’ systems, benefiting both primary production and conservation goals.",

However, we do not know how forces from airflow and food are sensed in the pharynx during breathing and eating, nor how this sensory information is fed back into the nerves and muscles in the pharynx so they can work in a coordinated way and rapidly adjust to changes. We will tackle this with an integrated series of experimental and modelling studies that will result in creation of the first 3D computer model of the pharynx that can simulate how the sensory system and muscles work during breathing and swallowing. To achieve this, we will identify the molecular machinery that encodes force and pressure detection in the pharynx and the neural circuits that provide sensory feedback to these muscles, and measure how the muscles respond to sensory inputs in humans. We will also develop new modelling technology to simulate how sensory information alters the contractions of the muscles of the pharynx and compare the model ouput to humans. This will provide the first full understanding of how the pharynx senses forces and pressures and how sensory input is integrated with individual anatomy by the nervous system to enable breathing and swallowing. Our model will also provide a platform for future development of oral devices and sensors. This project will further cement Australia's leadership in this field and create a platform for further research and development.",

AI is being adopted by public and private organisations, spanning algorithmic design and decision-making, robotics, public safety, mobility management, service delivery and more. National policy in Australia expects AI will make ‘better towns, cities and infrastructure’, but that can only occur if Australian cities marshall the appropriate set of institutions, the relevant combinations of expertise and practices, and effective regulatory mechanisms.  This project identifies key lessons from the ‘first mover’ sites of urban AI application inside and outside Australia and translates these learnings into the Australian context. Through its findings, methodologies and outputs including a podcast it will position Australian urban scholarship at the cutting edge of international debates and position urban governance practitioners to take advantage of first-mover lessons.

It will also produce associated software that allows users to classify their own genomes against the fungal GTDB. The systematic classification of thousands of new fungal genomes, including many from Australian habitats of economic (e.g. agricultural and forest soils) and cultural (e.g. native plants and animals) importance will enable domestic industries to discover new fungal candidates as starter cultures for beer, wine, bread and other fermented products.

Different models of planet formation make different predictions about whether these types of planets form more or less easily when there are two stars in the system compared to when there is only one star. There are not enough detected planets orbiting binary stars to test these theories. We have developed a new method to identify these \"circumbinary\" planets, which we will be able to use to identify more than 100 planets. This effort will benefit Australia, building its research capacity in astronomy and placing it at the forefront of this burgeoning field. It will also enable future Australian leadership of the next generation of telescopes that will provide data to discover even more of these planets in the future. The team working on this project will work closely with international partners in North America and Europe, enabling the researchers funded through this project to highlight Australia's commitment to astrophysics and data-driven discovery on the world's stage. The technical data analysis and statistical methods developed in this work will be of broad interest and use to researchers in machine learning and related fields, strengthening links with industry partners across Australia.",

India, a major agriculture exporter, is at risk of climate-induced food insecurity, a fast-growing global threat. This project aims to identify strategies for climate change resilience in the northeast Nagaland region through a study of past and present agriculture, earlier climate adaptations, vanishing traditional knowledge and dietary health. Working with local communities, it is expected to deliver new data to mitigate climate-related disasters, which jeopardize regional stability. Anticipated outcomes include policy recommendations and test projects to improve farming practices and address climate change impacts. As well as India, the project should deliver significant benefits for Australia, a major trade and diplomatic partner.\n",

Over 80% of the population lives in areas at risk from the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather events, unusually high or low temperatures and unexpected floods and droughts, all of which endanger the water supply, agriculture, health and infrastructure. Economic and social turmoil resulting from threats to food security in India – Australia’s fourth-largest export market, a fellow member of The Quad diplomatic partnership and one of the world’s biggest food producers – would adversely affect this country and have global implications, while posing the risk of financial crises and famine locally. Focusing on Nagaland, a highly vulnerable region in India’s northeast, this project will use techniques derived from archaeology and the environmental sciences to help local communities to develop food security strategies and resilience in the face of climate change, by uncovering the deep history of Naga agriculture, recording past responses to environmental variability, rescuing fast-fading traditional knowledge and documenting the wide variety of current farming practices. The findings, which will reduce the risk of regional insecurity and population migration, will be presented in accessible form to Naga communities to maximise their potential for direct translation. \n",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Plasmodium parasites can infect over 200 species of mammals, reptiles, birds, and amphibians. For example, certain Plasmodium species cause human malaria (>600,000 deaths annually), while others cause bird malaria in Australia and globally (e.g. decimating native Hawaiian bird populations). One of the challenges of Plasmodium biology is the complexity of the parasite’s growth processes, including understanding which are the key genes, proteins and metabolites involved in regulating these processes. This project will address this problem by investigating an important mechanism in Plasmodium that involves the modification of proteins and that influences almost all processes of cell biology including growth and infection. A better understanding of Plasmodium biology offers national benefits, including new insights on the biology of parasitism that may aid in the discovery of ways to monitor and target Plasmodium parasites important to human and animal health and improve understanding of current challenges such as drug resistance and zoonosis (transmission of Plasmodium from animal to human hosts). A further benefit will be mechanistic insights that will aid in the study of related parasites of veterinary importance to Australia, such as Babesia and Theileria that infect cattle and wildlife. The large protein and metabolism datasets arising from this project will be made open access, which will facilitate adoption and translation by other researchers in Australia and globally.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australia’s soils are valuable assets, supporting most of the nation’s biodiversity and food production. However, vast areas of Australia's soils have been degraded by human activities such as land clearing, overgrazing and urbanisation. Detecting, measuring and monitoring soil health is a major challenge, currently too costly, inefficient and intrusive to do at scale. Therefore, it is imperative to develop cost-effective and non-destructive ways to measure soil health to better guide soil management in natural ecosystem and agricultural contexts. This project will address major hurdles in measuring soil health through the novel use of ecoacoustics – the detection of acoustic waves emitted by sound-producing organisms. Our project will achieve a step-change in biodiversity monitoring knowledge, resulting in soil ecoacoustics tools which are effective at measuring soil health in common land use and soil types, as well as a mechanistic understanding of soil biota sound production. Our research will benefit Australians through an improved understanding of soil health, focusing primarily on improving how the sounds of the underground can be used to measure it. This has basic and applied science aspects and provides on-ground solutions to the economic, environmental, cultural and social threats associated with soil degradation. We will promote educational activities in schools and engage with the soil science sector to ensure rapid translation and adoption of research findings.",

This project will utilise Australia’s only exoplanet program on NASA’s flagship James Webb Space Telescope to test key hypotheses in planetary formation and migration that impact the atmospheres of planets. Our research will also leverage capabilities offered by the Twinkle space mission, the only space telescope with Australian partnership.

In the era of big data, efficient in-memory computing overcomes traditional computing architecture bottlenecks.

Metal halide perovskite FG-FETs offer cost-effective, energy-efficient solutions, especially for flexible and wearable devices and offer additional photo-memory capability for image recognition. This project aims to discover lead-free perovskites with reduced dimensional structure to enhance charge mobility and photosensitivity for non-volatile memory.

Such devices can be realized by floating-gate field-effect (FG-FET) transistors as they do not require additional capacitor or resistor for memory functions. Two-dimensional lead-free metal halide perovskites with excellent semiconductor properties are suitable materials for these transistors. Current developments have been limited to optimizing transistor components in a piece-wise manner. Therefore, this project aims to demonstrate a fully integrated rationally designed floating-gate synaptic memory via a multi-national collaborative and integrative research approach. Expected outcomes will benefit one of Australia’s critical technologies, “machine learning, including neural networks and deep learning” technology for “neuromorphic computing” application. Applications can be further extended to wearables or flexible electronics due to perovskites’ compatibility with flexible substrates and solution-based fabrications. Their tunable opto-electronic properties enable additional photo-memory, useful for image recognition. This project will bring social and economic benefits to Australia by training a new generation of scientists and engineers for the growing field of global neuromorphic computing.",

    "summary": "Mistaken Inference in Markets with Incomplete Information. The exponential growth of house prices in Australia may be caused in part by buyers over-paying due to incomplete information and mistaken inferences drawn from the behaviour of other buyers. This project aims to address the issue of mistaken inference, which is present in many markets in addition to real estate, by theoretically and experimentally analysing its implications for an array of negotiation mechanisms, such as auctions, bilateral bargaining and posted prices. Expected outcomes include new knowledge on the impact of mistaken inference on prices, market efficiency and welfare, which will inform policy on how to improve outcomes in markets with incomplete information when traders fall prey to inferential mistakes.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australia is in the midst of a housing crisis. With the housing price-to-income ratio increasing by over 45% between 2002 and 2022, housing is becoming less and less affordable. Buyers’ decisions in this market rely critically on their beliefs about property values and future prices, often formed under incomplete information. Buyers can form these beliefs by interpreting the behaviour of other buyers and sellers, and this can impact the negotiation process and its outcome (e.g., sale price). The proposed project aims to provide a theoretical and experimental analysis of markets with incomplete information, such as real estate, insurance and financial markets, where privately informed traders and uninformed ones often coexist. It seeks to investigate scenarios where market participants are potentially inexperienced or naive, and thus unable to correctly interpret information contained in others’ actions. By improving understanding of markets where participants try to learn from one another, this project aspires to provide guidance on how to regulate these markets and on how to evaluate the implications of different market structures for welfare and efficiency. Through this, the project can benefit Australia economically and socially by informing policies are likely to improve market outcomes. The project could also help the Australian community by improving social equity and supporting sustainable property markets.",

This project will develop a new approach to understand soil erosion in earth dams, from internal mechanisms to large-scale failures. It fills a significant gap in existing models, which cannot fully represent the complex, multi-scale processes of internal erosion. This approach combines detailed laboratory and field experiments with sophisticated computational modelling. It will create a reliable tool for predicting and mitigating dam failures, improving safety, resource management, and sustainability in water infrastructure. The escalating climate crisis and the imperative for the energy transition have triggered an unprecedented surge in global dam construction, and this model will help reduce the risks of these structures.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "There are no adequately accurate models to predict the onset of failure in dams. This is because existing models miss the connection between the behaviour of individual particles and the failure of the whole dam. This Project will address this by developing a comprehensive multi-scale model for soil erosion. This new heterarchical model directly responds to the lack of existing models that integrate the physics of erosion from particle-scale to large-scale failures, crucial for safeguarding against climate-induced disasters. The model will be validated against laboratory experiments using two cutting edge techniques, X-ray radiography and Spatial Time Domain Reflectometry. The model will be tested against data from custom built field scale dams which will be instrumented and monitored.\nThis research can prevent costly dam failures, saving resources and enhancing water management. Environmentally, it promotes ecosystem protection by forecasting and mitigating erosion risks. Socially, it will ensure community safety through improved infrastructure resilience. Culturally, it can aid in preserving historical dams, which are an important part of Australia's heritage.\nTo maximise the research's impact, we will disseminate findings through open access research publications, scholarly conferences and will host a workshop on the topic. We aim to integrate the research into engineering practice, contributing to long-term national benefit and international research collaborations.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australian deathcare practices are changing. A significant shift toward do-it-yourself commemoration is radically reshaping the sector and transforming how Australians care for their dead. Such practices include 'direct' cremation without ceremony, creative treatment of ashes for memorialisation, consumer-led DIY funerals, and alternative disposal arrangements for the body. The growing popularity of these new, hyper-personalised forms of commemoration significantly impacts Australia’s $1.7-billion funeral industry and the cultural, social, economic, and commercial environments that surround it. While such practices are proliferating in Australia and overseas, they are poorly understood by academics, the industry, religious and community organisations, and the wider public. This research project aims to address this gap through an interdisciplinary, multi-methods approach that uncovers the scope, drivers, and implications of these changes, informed through national surveys and fieldwork with families, deathcare professionals, and community leaders. Outcomes will be communicated through symposia, academic publications, public-facing exhibitions and popular media coverage. This research aims to advance scholarship on ritual change and – given the profound importance afforded to the treatment of the dead by families and communities – to extend knowledge in industry and society so as to chart a better path into the future for deathcare in Australia and internationally.\n",

    "summary": "More than the background: the role of  lipids in ion channel function. The movement of solutes in and out of cells underlies nerve impulses and our ability to sense the environment. It is controlled by ion channels, proteins located in cell membranes that open and close in response to different stimuli. But, we have only just begun to appreciate that the membrane and its lipid components actively contribute to regulating these proteins. We aim to explain how lipids regulate two important families of ion channel responsible for sensing touch and sending nerve signals, using a combination of cutting edge experimental and computational methods. These findings will address uncertainties in molecular biology and neuroscience, and provide a basis for predicting lipid regulation in a wide range of proteins.",

Such impulses are tightly controlled so that sensations don’t feel too weak (absent) or too strong (painful), and so that they don’t generate chaotic firing that can lead to seizures. This project aims to harness the collaborative expertise of multiple research teams to understand one way the individual cells in your body control such impulses through the properties of the cell membrane. The project is fundamental in nature, and will enrich our understanding of a range of biological processes that can be controlled by cell membranes. This research will have diverse implications, as we will study a range of organisms from humans to plants. For example, we will provide insight into our least understood sense, the ability to feel mechanical forces, as well as having benefit in agriculture and biotechnology providing directions for improving drought and salt tolerance of crops. The software developed in this project can be applied to understanding a wide range of other cellular components and we expect it to be utilised by researchers studying diverse biological processes.",

This project aims to provide a transnational and comparative history of efforts to abolish corporal punishment in Australia and Britain, and to explain the partial success of these efforts. It expects to generate new knowledge about human rights and children’s rights campaigns based on extensive archival research, including the analysis of recently declassified material. Expected outcomes include an explanation of why abolitionists succeeded in banning the hitting of children in schools but not in the home. Anticipated benefits include a better identification of paths to reform in this space than the idea, common in the public health literature, that scientific studies and human rights reports will ‘trickle down’ into public opinion.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Neuroscientists and child psychologists have demonstrated that the physical punishment of children has adverse consequences on the brain development and mental health of children into adulthood. The widespread use of corporal punishment by carers is a pressing health concern for young Australians. International human rights bodies condemn the physical punishment of children and young people. Liberal democracies face a countervailing pressure to respect parents' choices about how to raise their children. Today 65 countries have full legal bans on the punishment of children and young people. Australia and the United Kingdom have outlawed it in schools but not in the home. Why are Australia and Britain outliers? And why have parents' right to smack their children proved more resilient than teachers' powers to cane their pupils, when not so long ago the two were in lockstep? This project will use unpublished archival sources from approximately 1970 to 2000 to fill this gap in knowledge and provide this explanation. The research has the potential to benefit Australians socially and culturally by drawing out the lessons of this still-live history: historical case studies from the recent past provide an opportunity to think through these dilemmas more clearly and dispassionately. Through a policy paper and other public-facing outputs the project team will promote its findings beyond academia to maximise understanding of this history and its ongoing consequences.",

Despite its critical role in cognition and in modern neuro-inspired artificial intelligence, the neural mechanisms of compositional cognitive processes in the human brain remain elusive. Our distinguished interdisciplinary team – leveraging expertise in psychopharmacology, neuroimaging, and neural modelling – is poised to illuminate this complexity. We will combine dynamic neural signatures during cognitive tasks, the perturbation of neurochemical systems, and advanced biophysical models to test our novel neuromodulatory compositionality hypothesis. Our research will provide unprecedented insights into the neurobiology of compositional cognition, and in this way, will accelerate the convergence of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.",

This ability to recombine knowledge in new ways is a core feature of human intelligence. We use it every time we solve a new problem, learn a new concept or create a new thought. Despite its ubiquity in our daily lives, we do not know how the brain achieves this. This interdisciplinary project uses state-of-the-art neuroscience techniques to show the neural, chemical and computational brain processes that enable us to reuse and recombine knowledge. Impairments in this core cognitive capacity lead to learning deficits and rigid thinking patterns, which affect people during development and normal ageing. By identifying the underlying neural-chemical brain processes, the project will inform new pharmacological, brain stimulation and cognitive training strategies to improve learning and creativity, leading to profound social and economic benefits for Australia. Beyond this, the human capacity to reuse and recombine knowledge is a major inspiration for modern artificial intelligence. By identifying the computational processes, the project is designed to directly inform biologically-inspired artificial intelligence algorithms, with the potential for widespread commercial applications and significant economic benefits.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Wave energy converters (WECs) and floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) are structures which float in the ocean while converting waves and winds into electricity.  The way they oscillate in response to wave loads depends on the mechanical and electrical settings given by their operators, and can therefore change from day to day.  In this respect, they are very different to traditional floating platforms, which behave in the same manner across time.  Understanding the nature of the wave loading on WECs and FOWTs is essential to bring down their cost, and thus increase the speed of the transition to net zero.\n\nIn this project, we will develop a new method to better understand wave loads on these structures.  This method will involve testing WECs and FOWTs in the lab across a carefully chosen range of settings, with waves made by a wave paddle and motions imposed by an actuator.  By systematically combining the results from a range of tests we can break the loading down into more easily understood pieces to enable cheaper design and more efficient operation.\n\nBecause Australia has the best wave energy resource in the world, and one of the best for offshore wind, we stand to benefit significantly from development of these new industries.  In addition, our region is hungry for new offshore solutions that Australian ingenuity can provide.  Our methods can be widely adopted by offshore engineering industries and the team conducting this research has many links to this industry.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "How to make solar electricity more efficient, affordable and reliable is one of the grand challenges in 21st century to address the global issue of climate change and the increasing demand for energy in the society. Bifacial semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST-PSCs) are a new photovoltaic (PV) technology that can produce electricity when illuminated on both sides (front or rear) of the device by using a material called metal halide perovskite, rendering them suitable for applications in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) and smart windows by fully using not only direct sunlight illumination, but also environmental reflected and diffuse sunlight to achieve higher areal energy yield. This project addresses the critical issues of inefficient transparent electrode, that limits the performance of existing ST-PSCs. The main research outcomes of new transparent electrodes with desirable optoelectronic and chemical properties for efficient bifacial ST-PSCs will advance adoption of perovskite based photovoltaic technology in practical applications such as BIPVs, placing Australia at the forefront of exploitation of this new PV technology for more efficient utilization of solar energy. The outcomes of this research project align with the two priority areas in Australian Government National Reconstruction announced in 2022: “Renewables and Low Emission Technologies”, and “Enabling Capabilities”.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The Government’s 2021 NEAT Policy (Advanced Air Mobility and National Emerging Aviation Technology) highlights the role of electrified aviation in Australia’s quest to reduce carbon emissions and reach a “net zero” future. However, existing motors are not powerful, compact, or sustainable enough to deliver on the promise of electric aircraft and high-power drones. While permanent magnet motors are the preferred choice for these emerging applications due to their high efficiency and power density, they cannot yet produce the power-to-weight ratio needed for carbon-neutral aviation and next-generation electric vehicles. This project aims to develop the first-ever permanent magnet motor with the required kilowatts-per-kilogram specification using fewer rare-earth materials. The high energy-density rare earth materials used in permanent magnet machines already benefit Australia as the world’s second-largest supplier. The developing drone sector could boost Australia’s GDP by $14.5 billion over 20 years (NEAT 2021). By sharing project findings with stakeholders in aviation and automotive technology via workshops, publications and commercialisation opportunities for IP licensing, this project should enable the adoption of Australian-designed cutting-edge permanent magnet motors in next-generation electric vehicles, aircraft and drones. Crucially, a highly efficient, lightweight motor designed and manufactured in Australia will also ensure the sector’s geopolitical self-reliance. ",

However, these new options are not well understood or captured in current housing, economic, and other relevant policies, amplifying existing difficulties in accessing affordable and healthy housing. Our research will combine comprehensive analyses of national and international datasets over time to explore emerging trends, new housing pathways, and their links with health and wellbeing outcomes; with innovative application of change theory in evaluating decision drivers and predictions from key actors in the housing market (renters, landlords, owners, and policy makers) to understand how to best shape the future housing market. Research impact will be maximised through communication with policy makers, housing organisations, and the public, i.e., by producing policy briefs, short reports, and accessible summaries to optimise delivery of actionable outcomes to improve housing experiences and equity for all Australians. The research will also be of global importance, as many other countries face similar housing challenges, with this project placing Australia at the forefront of tackling this global problem.",

Focused on kelp forests, climate change and marine heatwaves, the research aims to reveal community-level shifts in this biodiversity hotspot in response to our changing oceans. The project will use ecological surveys, experiments, and models to better understand future trajectories of the GSR, including identifying areas displaying resistance to climate and human-driven impacts, and the quantifying the consequences of transformations to replacement habitats on the functioning of this valuable temperate ecosystem. The project will build capacity by training new marine biologists and by consolidating extensive, long-term data sets covering over 1000 kilometers, a vital baseline and resource for future research. The new understanding generated by the project will open opportunities for conservation and sustainable management, not only for the GSR but for kelp forests more broadly. The project's significance is underscored by the GSRs economical, ecological and cultural importance: it contributes >$10 billion/yr to the economy, >70% of its species are found nowhere else on Earth, and it connects over 50 indigenous nations. To this end, the project will help secure an overlooked, yet invaluable temperate marine ecosystem in Australia.",

On-shift naps boost performance and safety at night, but taking a nap removes the worker from the job, and temporary performance impairments upon waking from naps may mean additional downtime. By employing a rigorous sleep laboratory protocol, this project will determine the best nap length for safety and productivity – something we cannot determine from current evidence. The expected outcome is to establish evidence-based guidelines for on-shift napping, aiming to improve workplace productivity and safety with minimal disruption to operational efficiency.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Night work is critical for Australia's economic prosperity, supporting essential sectors such as healthcare, emergency response, and transportation. But performance, productivity, and safety are all lower on the night shift because humans have evolved to sleep at night. We know that naps on night shift can enhance performance, but workplaces choose not to use them because they take workers off the job and safety can be impacted by post-nap sleep inertia. But research to date has not asked whether nap length can be optimised so that the costs of downtime are outweighed by the benefits of whole shift productivity. Our project will fill this gap.\n\nThe potential benefits of this research include a reduction in night work-related productivity losses, estimated at $17.9 billion annually, and a decrease in workplace accidents, costing over $61.8 billion. Outcomes will include new knowledge and evidence-based guidance on the impacts of on-shift napping for productivity and safety. Findings will support the development of tools for strategic nap scheduling, boosting operational productivity in industries that rely on night work.\n \nOutcomes will be communicated by direct community outreach including media, industry forums, and public science events, facilitated by a formal communication strategy to influence national policy and operational standards. \n\n\n",

This project will answer the question: how do members of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) super family of channels contribute to cellular force sensing?  TRP channels do not fit the classic paradigm of force sensing channels as they are not activated by membrane stretch. This project will determine if TRPs can be activated by a different type of force (tensile forces applied at cell adhesion sites) and aims to establish a new paradigm for mechanosensing, where select TRP channels function as mechano-amplifiers to boost the signal from a classical stretch-activated primary mechanosensor, i.e. PIEZO1.

Improving outcomes for our rapidly aging population will drive social wellbeing and economic growth.

Over a third of Australian workers engage in hybrid work yet productivity has fallen and mental ill health of workers increased. This suggests the benefits of hybrid work are not being realised. Currently, organisations are implementing hybrid work policies and practices with no guiding evidence as to how to do so optimally. Our project will examine how, why and for whom hybrid work impacts wellbeing and performance, and evaluate workplace interventions to increase the effectiveness and beneficial outcomes of hybrid work. It will develop evidence-based practical guidelines to enable practitioners, policymakers, and managers to design high quality hybrid work. This will benefit the Australian economy by increasing organisational effectiveness and reducing the economic burden of mental ill health. Social and cultural benefits include facilitating increased participation in the workforce by those typically excluded, such as carers or those with decreased mobility, and increasing workers’ sense of belonging and purpose.

    "summary": "Breaking the Cycle: Understanding Precarity in Australia’s Youth Workforce. The project aims to identify ‘necessary’ conditions that predispose youth to insecure, poorly paid and regulated, or precarious, work and widening precarity (e.g., eroded development, welfare reliance, low productivity) by taking a life history approach using archival longitudinal data supported by original data triangulated across young workers, their families, and employers. It expects to generate novel evidence on the cycle from preexisting precarity to precarious work to widening precarity. Expected outcomes include workplace change recommendations to break the cycle and better support young workers. This should yield significant benefits by reducing the societal and economic costs (estimated $billions) of a scarred youth precariat. ",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Precarious employment (insecure with poor conditions, pay and benefits) presents a significant and growing issue for Australia, with youth most at-risk. Yet we know little about what predisposes youth to precarious employment and how that shapes their psychological construction of work and life phenomena, general worldview and a perpetual cycle of precarity. Addressing these knowledge gaps is critical to breaking the cycle. This project aims to identify factors across the life-histories of youths that predispose them to precarious employment trajectories during the adult workforce transition and the effects on their development and adjustment. We will document youth’s lived experiences of workplace-based needs, risks, supports and barriers and gather employers’ and family’s perceptions. Findings will transform the field beyond a focus on individual intervention to address systemic workplace and social risks, barriers and needed change, ensuring outcomes can be translated into actionable recommendations that will be presented to industry, worker organisations, support agencies and government for adoption and will fuel further research. Breaking the precarity cycle is vital to build a psychologically healthy and productive future Australian workforce. This will have important economic and social benefits for young workers directly via recommended workplace-based change (e.g., improved job design) and for organisations via high returns on investment (e.g., productivity gains).",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "In Australia, approximately 1.5 million tons of desalination concentrates are generated daily, containing numerous valuable ions worth over $1000 per ton. These ions are essential in construction, energy, agriculture, and chemical processes. Disposing of these concentrated brines into waterways is wasteful, costly, and environmentally harmful. There is an urgent need to develop new technologies capable of efficiently recovering valuable ions from these waste products, as current methods are inefficient and cannot recover specific metal ions for reuse. Therefore, this project aims to advance separation technologies to recover these valuable minerals, reduce waste during water treatment, and enhance mineral processing efficiency. \nThe outcomes will yield substantial economic and environmental benefits for Australia by reducing waste from the water and mining industries, conserving resources, and mitigating the environmental impact of industrial processes. Enhanced recovery and separation technologies can lower operational costs for water treatment facilities by improving process efficiency and reducing the need for chemical additives. Additionally, the project has the potential to offer commercial benefits by positioning Australia as a leader in efficient ion mining technologies.\nWe will actively promote the outcomes through invited talks, webinars, and collaboration with industry stakeholders to reduce global desalination waste and improve resource extraction efficiency.",

The project aims to enhance robotic perception in challenging environments such as murky water and extreme weather where state-of-the-art approaches fail. By developing new representations and processing architectures capable of introspection, it enables robots to recognise and adapt to their own perceptual limitations. Expected outcomes are robotic systems with unprecedented resilience in challenging application domains like infrastructure monitoring and autonomous driving. This should bring economic benefit to Australia with broad robotic deployments in environmental monitoring and understanding of critical marine and terrestrial ecosystems, parks, and infrastructure, and improved mobility for the elderly and disabled.",

Managing our agricultural and ecological resources and ageing infrastructure and transport systems will increasingly rely on resilient robotic systems. However, robots are not ready for widespread deployment as their perception systems fail in challenging conditions such as murky water and adverse weather. This project will develop the knowledge required to construct resilient robotic systems that introspect to reason and act on the limitations of their perception systems. This will allow much broader deployment across diverse application areas critical to a secure and sustainable economic future. It will improve monitoring, understanding and management of critical ecosystems and infrastructure and environmental change in marine ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef which is worth billions of dollars annually and is of critical ecological importance on a global scale. It will improve assessment of parks, fisheries and shipping lanes and enable maintenance of cables, pipelines, roads and buildings. We will promote this work beyond academia through ongoing outreach programs employing traditional and social media, by publishing tools and tutorials and by supporting clubs and activities open to the general public. As the technologies of this program reach maturity we will continue our long history of engaging with industry and government partners to bridge the gap to practical deployment.",

By characterising ecophysiology of discovered microbes, identifying new microbes and deciphering their metabolic pathways, this project expects to provide new knowledge on undiscovered microorganisms and undescribed links between global SCGA and nitrogen cycles.

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) demonstrate a great potential to replace expensive lithium-ion batteries for energy storage as sodium is low-cost, safe and abundant as compared to lithium. However, the larger radius of sodium ions often leads to a sluggish kinetics process, and they cannot intercalate into commonly used anode materials like graphite. This project aims to investigate the atomic level sodium storage mechanism in hard carbon and develop a novel green hydrothermal carbonisation process to obtain spherical microstructures via combined experiment and atomistic modelling. This project will not only fill the knowledge gaps in developing high performance SIBs but guide the establishment of sustainable hard carbon manufacture industry.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries for long term and large scale energy storage, due to high abundance of sodium, low cost, inherent safety and high energy density. Hard carbon has been recognised as viable electrode material as it can be produced from low-cost biomass or polymers. However, the overall battery performance is relatively poor and the sodium storage mechanism in hard carbon has not been well understood. This project will develop innovative, bottom-up strategies to optimise the structure of lignin-based hard carbon from sugarcane bagasse to achieve high battery performance. The sodium storage mechanism will be investigated at atomic scale through combined experimental and modelling approaches. The project will not only fill the existing knowledge gaps in development of carbon-based sodium-ion batteries but provide technical support for utilising Australian biomass and minerals to develop next generation rechargeable batteries for renewable energy storage, contributing to the establishment of multi-billion-dollar biorefinery and battery materials industries, in line with the newly released National Battery Strategy - Leading the charge towards a competitive and diverse Australian battery industry. The project outcomes will be released through industry magazines, university and social media, and broadcast/TV to increase public awareness and attract industry investment towards technology transfer and commercialisation.",

    "summary": "Chemo-mechanical behavior in all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. Currently available commercial lithium-ion batteries do not satisfy the increasing demands of portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, due to low energy densities, safety issues and high cost. High capacity electrode materials such as Li metal anode, Ni-rich cathode together with solid-state electrolytes have been confirmed as promising alternatives. However, poor interface stability and material failure remain as significant challenges. The project aims to solve these coupled chemo-mechanical problems through in situ characterisation and advanced modelling technologies. The expected outcomes will help develop next generation batteries and fill the key knowledge gaps in broad energy materials.",

However, in addition to potential safety issues, their energy densities cannot meet the ever-growing demand for high performance energy\nstorage systems to power mobile devices with increased power consumption and to extend the driving range of electric vehicles. To address these issues, this project aims to develop all solid-state lithium metal batteries with superior safety and high energy and power densities. Through collaborating with the Australian mining industry, a top exporter for almost all materials required for manufacturing high performance batteries, this project will identify opportunities for establishing Australia’s future battery industry for value added products, in line with the newly released National Battery Strategy - Leading the charge towards a competitive and diverse Australian battery industry. Uniting the Australian research community, government agencies and local industries, it will also contribute to Australia’s current efforts in building national battery testing centres and research hubs.",

To ensure Australian consumers also benefit from this progress, competition policy - credible, evidence-based enforcement of competitive behaviour - has an ever more important role to play.\n \nTraditional analytical frameworks that guide competition policy rest on ad-hoc restrictions on firms’ behavior. Recommendations based on these are, therefore, vulnerable to the criticism that the conditions on which they are based may not be valid after a policy change, for example, a merger. The proposed project uses an innovative analytical framework that is robust to this criticism to provide fundamental insights into the effects of mergers, firms' incentives and ability to collude, and regulatory interventions. It gives competition authorities like the ACCC a reliable economic framework to analyze mergers, acquisitions and anticompetitive conduct. It will lead to software tools for diagnostic tests that quantify the likely effects of mergers on firms' abilities to collude and the competitive effects of mergers.\n\nBy improving competition policy, the project will lead to lower prices and thereby greater choice for Australian consumers. Translation and dissemination through workshops with practitioners and researchers will promote the outcomes and lead to their adoption in future research.",

The immune system needs to distinguish between these dangerous bacteria and other environmental factors that do not cause harm. This ensures that the immune system is effective and only activated when it needs to be. However, there are significant knowledge gaps about how animal immune cells detect and destroy dangerous bacteria. A better understanding of this would enable us to switch on specific parts of the immune system to fight bacterial infections. In future, this is expected to lead to the development of vaccines and/or drugs to maintain and/or improve the health of Australian livestock and companion animals. The same knowledge may also help us to reduce antibiotic use and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the agriculture and veterinary sectors. This project also expects to develop a technology to monitor a component of the immune system, for development by the biotechnology industry. Research outcomes are expected to be promoted through industry engagement so that anti-infective agents and immune-monitoring tools can be developed for the Australian livestock, veterinary and/or biotechnology industries to provide economic benefit to Australia, as well as environmental benefit through reduced antibiotic use.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "All plant and animal cells create natural ‘bioenergy’ within small cell structures called organelles. Researchers have recently managed to create artificial organelles that can produce a similar type of energy, but all present challenges. One main type responds to an external stimulus we can control, but we cannot ‘tune’ its reaction to take it more efficiently. The other is tuneable, but does not respond to external stimuli, meaning we cannot control its energy production.\n\nThis project seeks to develop a completely new type of artificial organelle – one that is both controllable and tuneable – to create on-demand bioenergy. The applications for such an organelle are extensive, ranging from waste treatment to veterinary medicine and nutraceutical supplements. Additionally, by creating a ‘platform technology’, the project would pave the way to develop new products and processes with even greater national benefits.\n\nTo promote our research beyond academia, we will use both the UNSW Industry & Innovation office and UNSW Newsroom to promote our research outcomes to industry, commercial entities and the wider community. Through licensing of IP and established relationships with industry partners SoHi and Cartago Biotech, we will ensure that this new research can be adapted into a bioenergy production strategy and associated products to create commercial, social and environmental benefits for Australia.",

This project aims to generate knowledge of how people living in three Australian regions (the Wimmera-Mallee in Victoria, the Northern Rivers region of NSW and the Perth-Peel metropolitan region) are responding to long-term, place-based environmental change. It considers this in relation to two international regions facing similar challenges (Gotland, Sweden and Northeast England) to understand what community-led repair looks like on the ground, and what formal disaster response can learn from this. Previous research has focused on documenting the causes of environmental change, and how to prevent and manage this change, whereas less research has considered how to repair the harm and loss associated with altering environments. This research is particularly significant in light of the enormity of the reparative task and the need to prioritise limited resources for environmental repair work. This project will benefit the future adaptation efforts of Australia, leading to improved understandings of what supports the success of localised repair work. In addition to academic outcomes, including PhD and early career pathways, the project will produce creative and publicly available outputs, including an atlas, story maps and field guides, and engage with community and policy stakeholders to inform responses to ongoing environmental change.",

It will benefit Australians by exploring whether the most ambitious climate goals could be met and citizens’ wellbeing improved. Modelling tools from this project can be used by policy-makers, sustainability practitioners and scholars to test key degrowth policies for their efficiency on improved social provisioning and cohesion, better mitigation, adaptation and resilience. \n\nProject outcomes will be discussed at a workshop and through direct dialogues with national and international collaborators and stakeholders, including from the UN, with the aim of leveraging this research for global climate governance.

The significance of these spaces stems from their central role in deep areas of mathematics and physics, such as the geometric Langlands program, mirror symmetry, and Yang--Mills theory. Expected outcomes include resolution of long-standing conjectures regarding invariants of character varieties. The benefits include applications in number theory and knot theory, and more broadly in cybersecurity, quantum computing, and economics. We will also strengthen the Australian mathematical research community by creating a hub in the southern hemisphere for the study of character varieties.",

It will address a major knowledge gap by investigating the effects of a) rain/drought, b) plastic ageing and c) mobility of smaller nanoplastic debris that are more easily absorbed by humans, animals and plants; compelling evidence exists about the importance of these poorly understood factors. \nThe knowledge and techniques generated by this project will contribute to better management of plastic waste and a circular economy in Australia, with consequent economic benefits. It will generate direct and long-term environmental, social and cultural benefits for Australians by contributing to more pristine aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, including iconic beaches and sites of cultural and heritage value, and health benefits from lower exposure to plastic.\nResearch outcomes will be promoted in press releases, social, print and audio-visual media, as well as a one-day workshop.

In this light, optimisation methods that efficiently utilise computational resources are crucial. Newton-type optimisation methods achieve this by leveraging the problem's geometric structure. However, a critical yet often overlooked aspect in their development is efficiently solving their subproblems, which is essential for their success and adoption. This project aims to innovate mathematical methods that can revolutionise Newton-type optimisation algorithms, with a focus on subproblem solvers. The project's outcomes include methods that efficiently utilise available computational resources, offering tangible economic and environmental benefits, including reduced costs and carbon footprint in large-scale machine learning computations. These methods will be made accessible to Australian businesses and researchers relying on machine learning tools through the development of open-source software compatible with existing industrial machine learning platforms. This will be accompanied by case studies, tutorials and online courses to facilitate the translation of academic research into practical knowledge for practitioners and industry members, as well as to help with the realisation of these economic and environmental benefits.",

Australia bears a significant portion of these costs through increased foreign aid and losses to overseas investments by Australian companies. While effective early warning systems can reduce fatalities and economic losses, current systems rely on outdated models. This project's innovative sensors have the potential to significantly improve these early warning systems.\n\nThese sensors measure changes in gravity, which can be detected earlier than the seismic waves currently used, significantly increasing warning lead times. Even a modest increase in lead time is crucial for protecting critical facilities, halting hazardous activities, and facilitating evacuation. This will lead to more effective impact mitigation, allowing our Asia-Pacific neighbors to recover quickly, maintain economic stability, and further strengthen Australia's diplomatic and historical relationships with Indo-Pacific countries.\n\nThis project will enable Australian scientists to contribute to and potentially deliver Australian-designed hardware and software for improved emergency early warning systems. It will also foster greater collaboration and dissemination of results within Australia's advanced research sector and the international seismic research community.",

    "summary": "A Probabilistic Approach to Big Data-Based Industrial Process Control. Based on the behavioural systems theory for stochastic systems, this project aims to develop a novel probabilistic behavioural process control approach by utilizing big industrial process operation data. Unlike many existing data-driven control methods for deterministic systems, the proposed approach deals with the uncertain operation conditions encountered in daily industry operations by using the statistical information from big process data and controlling the probability distribution of process variables (e.g., leading to products with more consistent specifications). The research outcomes are expected to help the Australian process industries leverage the power of Industry 4.0 to improve the efficiency and economy of their operations.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australia has very strong process/manufacturing industries representing over $873bn turnovers and $350bn value added per annum. In these industries, many modern plants are very complex but are often controlled by simple logic controllers that deliver inadequate performance. Furthermore, plant operations are always subject to uncertainties (e.g., variations in raw material specifications, environmental conditions and energy costs). This project aims to develop a novel big data-based process control approach to operate these complex processes and improve their energy and materials efficiencies and the consistency of the product specifications by using the statistical/probability information from big process data. This project is expected to help the Australian process industries improve their competitiveness in the global market while reducing their environmental footprints. A big data-based process control framework that deals with process uncertainties is becoming a cornerstone of future manufacturing with Industry 4.0 turning into reality. This research project will enhance Australia’s scientific reputation in the international arena. This project falls in Australian Government’s National Science and Research Priority goal of “Advanced manufacturing: cross-cutting technologies that will de-risk, scale up, and add value to Australian manufactured products”.",

However, shape-shifters have been notoriously difficult to make in the laboratory, which has stalled research and development in this area for many decades. Recent breakthroughs from our team have finally begun to solve this problem.\n\nThis project will advance the field by introducing easy and practical laboratory methods to make these molecules.  From there we will explore a range of prototype applications including new concepts in drug discovery (shape-shifting antibiotics and peptide mimics), advances in liquid crystals, as well as demonstrating new concepts in molecular switches and sensors. This work will advance our knowledge of these molecules and how to manipulate their properties .  While this area of research is still in its infancy, it has the potential for applications in medicine and high-tech manufacturing, to the benefit of Australia’s industries.\n\nOutcomes from this project will be communicated through academic journals and conferences to promote further research.

The global seafood supply chain, including fishing in Australian waters and imports into Australia, is tainted by the abuse of fishers and their lack of access to remedy. It is especially apparent that the Indo-Pacific fishing industry has been built on the back of “seafood slaves”. While awareness of modern slavery in Australia has increased in the last five years among business, advocates and consumers, the provision of remedy to fishers trapped on vessels remains a critical gap. This project will examine the lack of accountability in public and private governance and propose effective remedies under national, regional and international laws for fishers caught in modern slavery. Our research will support Australian business by providing a toolkit aimed at preventing and remedying modern slavery at sea. Through engagement with Australian government officials, publications and public events, the project provides (1) critical knowledge to policymakers to support Australia in showing leadership in regional initiatives responding to this problem, and (2) will contribute to the development of a national framework to combat illegal fishing practices, which should include consideration of the people who catch the fish supplied to Australia.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "On any given day there are 30 million people at sea. We need to know not just what international laws provide protection, but who has international law duties to prevent harm or to assist these people at sea. International law typically assumes the state will provide protection. But recent events indicate that non-state actors, such as shipping companies and humanitarian workers, also owe duties to protect people at sea. These duties were evident when passengers and crew were stranded on cruise ships during the pandemic and when volunteers have sought to deliver aid to Gaza. Duties may arise under different bodies of international law, such as the law of the sea, international human rights law and international labour law. This project will identify what duties international law imposes on non-state actors, how those duties operate in practice and what mechanisms are available to enforce those duties. This research will close a growing gap in ocean governance and contribute to Australia’s management of ocean activities and the defence of its maritime interests. The findings will support Australia to meet its own legal obligations and to enforce obligations owed by other actors. Through diverse publications, presentations and community engagement, this research will also assist Australian lawyers, advocates and government officials who are seeking to ensure that any Australians who travel, fish or work at sea receive the rights to which they are entitled.",

Longer lives, and major demographic, social and cultural changes, have increased the importance of grandparenting for the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities. The research expects to address a major gap in the study of grandparenting - its evolution over time, in relation to profound changes in society, including life expectancy, gender rights, and multiculturalism. Expected outcomes include a new historical understanding of grandparenting, and guidelines for the collection of family histories. The project should provide significant benefits by helping scholars and policy makers shape grandparents' key contribution to Australia's future.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australia is an aging society. In families with working parents, elderly grandparents increasingly provide the largest, most frequent, consistent, long-lasting and intimate form of childcare and family support. They have a crucial role to play in the social, economic and psychological wellbeing of families. However, grandparents and the role of grandparenting has a limited focus in current public discourse, and within existing government policy frameworks. Drawing on the historical and current experiences of families and communities, this project will deliver the untold story of how grandparenting in Australia has changed over time, and its impact on our society. Through community dialogues and public events; a digital guide to family history; a podcast on grandparenting; and media and social media outputs; the Australian community and key policy makers will gain critical insights into the role and influence of grandparenting. Access to these resources will help to guide and inform the development of future social and economic policies on ageing and aged care, childcare, family welfare, and employment. This will contribute to social equity and economic productivity of the broader Australian society, and a strengthening of the overall wellbeing of Australian families. ",

Maximising well-being and resilience requires a full understanding of the complex dynamics of real-world emotions, which cannot be achieved using standard linear statistical approaches. This project aims to apply cutting-edge empirical dynamic modelling tools, developed by ecologists to characterise complex systems, to model emotions in the world's largest database of daily emotional experience. Expected outcomes include new interdisciplinary collaborations, enhanced research capacity, and new knowledge of theorised complex emotion dynamics.

However, real-world emotions remain poorly understood because scientists have lacked the analytic tools and large-scale data needed to characterise the intricate, and seemingly unpredictable ways that emotions unfold. We address this gap by applying mathematical techniques from ecology to the world's largest daily emotion database to model the complex dynamics of real-world emotion. The knowledge generated by this project will improve scientific models of emotion and will thus inform how to effectively manage emotions to maximise resilience. As emotions are central to virtually every domain of human functioning, this project’s findings could benefit Australians by informing efforts to increase job productivity, improve social relationships, and enhance overall well-being. To ensure our research outcomes reach a wide audience, we will communicate our findings via media engagement and public-facing workshops. To maximise the future translational potential of our findings, we will engage with mental-health practitioners who develop and implement novel online/digital treatments for a range of common emotional disorders. Finally, by introducing novel mathematical tools to psychology, this project may improve understanding of other psychological processes beyond emotion.",

    "summary": "Developing an analytic theory of monoidal categories. The project's aim is to introduce fundamentally new methods to the field of monoidal categories by using an innovative analytic approach. Monoidal categories are ubiquitous in mathematics and cognate fields such as computer science. However, current techniques draw almost exclusively from algebraic and combinatorial ideas which are closer to the origin of the theory of monoidal categories. The project will overcome current limitations by introducing interdisciplinary methods and applying them to pressing open problems where the usual approaches fail. The outcome will be new results in representation theory and a new theory to study monoidal categories. This will have benefits within mathematics and also in physics/chemistry in the long run.",

While healthcare AI is expected to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients, decrease healthcare costs, and make healthcare more accessible, the adoption of AI tools in practice has been slow. This is due to a lack of trust in AI and safety issues, which are in turn caused by a lack of transparency around AI functioning and limitations. Based on new empirical data, this project will develop a first of its kind AI Transparency Map that identifies stakeholders’ transparency needs for AI healthcare technologies and current transparency gaps. The project will then collect best industry practices and international policy approaches to improve AI transparency, and develop a Model Framework proposing legal, policy and governance measures that will foster AI transparency around healthcare AI. These project outputs will enable governments and stakeholders improve transparency around healthcare AI, which will lead to increased trust and safer use of AI, and eventually speed up the adoption of these promising technologies in practice. The interdisciplinary and international project team will leverage their extensive industry contacts and engage with healthcare, AI and policy stakeholders throughout the project, which will ensure that the project benefits the targeted stakeholders and the society at large.",

This project aims to improve Australia’s economic response to climate change by evaluating the strategies that are being developed to meet decarbonisation and resilience goals. It will generate new knowledge about the ‘climate economy’ using an innovative method to understand its ‘hybrid’ actors, policies and institutions. Expected outcomes of this project include a new conceptual toolkit and evidence-based strategies for researchers and practitioners to engage and improve Australia’s emerging climate economy. This should provide significant benefits by building capacity among policy makers, investors, and citizens to pursue effective, democratic, and just climate responses in an era of political-economic transformation.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australia has responded to its international competitors by announcing a suite of ambitious economy-wide policy initiatives to boost and steer investment in critical climate infrastructure and industries. Focusing on energy, transport and water infrastructure, this project will investigate these government initiatives that aim to achieve net-zero emissions and climate adaptation goals while simultaneously enhancing national and economic security and delivering wider community benefits. In doing so, it will address a research gap in existing knowledge about the new kinds of institutions and policy tools that are involved in developing and implementing this ‘climate economy’ and how these changes affect policy outcomes and public engagement. By developing evidence-based strategies for governments, industries and civil society organisations, this project will contribute to securing Australia’s economic prosperity and increase resilience to climate and other risks. It will also build the capacity of citizens to understand and engage with these strategies so that the benefits of economic transformation are widely shared. The project will promote its outcomes by publishing an independent review and policy briefs for policy makers, investors and civil society organisations, and an interactive online map and budget so that members of the public can better follow climate policies, finance and projects in Australia.",

This research has a number of economic and social benefits for Australian women, men, and society more broadly: Gender equality in the workplace is associated with increased gross domestic product, greater productivity, improved well-being, and better access to parental leave and flexible working arrangements for all employees. The research outcomes of this project will be regularly communicated to policy makers, organisations and the broader community through a public-facing website with the findings collated in a freely available toolkit to inform allyship interventions for workplace gender equality.

Expected outcomes include new bio-characterisation techniques, and closing the knowledge gap in the field of stem cell stimulation. This should provide significant benefits for patient derived tissue engineering, maintaining Australia’s position at the forefront of basic stem cell research.",

This project is about understanding electrical stimulation can be used to control how stem cells turn into bone, cartilage, fat tissue. Currently, we do not fully understand how electrical stimulation treatment can induce stem cells to grow into specific terminal cell types. The project will use cutting-edge tools to understand the changes in living stem cells in real-time, both inside and out, including the first system in Australia capable of performing single cell biopsies. Understanding how stem cells grow into different cell types can underpin the development of a stem cell treatment technology capable of inducing bone, cartilage, and muscle tissue would generate an efficient and cost-effective approach for patient specific musculoskeletal tissue engineering. The outcomes of this project will be disseminated and promoted via publications, conferences, and media statements in turn, this knowledge will benefit the regenerative medicine industry in Australia through the development of new technologies and products which utilise electrical stimulation for tissue repair and regeneration.

The magnetohydrodynamic heat shield concept, which uses a magnetic field to control the hot plasma flowing around the spacecraft, will enable vehicles entering Earth's atmosphere to follow trajectories with considerably reduced heating. Minimal research in this field has accounted for how the magnetic field deforms due to the plasma flowing through it, yet this effect is expected to be significant for a full scale spacecraft. This project aims to experimentally reproduce and characterise this phenomemon. Its significance will be providing the first ever measurements of this effect. The expected outcome and benefit will be new understanding and new simulation capabilities, both essential to developing a functional full scale heat shield.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "When a spacecraft enters Earth’s atmosphere, air flowing around it gets so hot that electrons are ripped off the atoms. Future heat shields may use lightweight magnets to push against this hot, electrically conducting gas, to reduce heating and enhance flight control. When this technology is scaled up to large spacecraft, physics tells us that the magnetic field, like the flow itself, will start to fold back around the spacecraft. The research gap we will address is to conduct the first ever experiments to induce this magnetic field deformation behaviour in an aerodynamic flow. These experiments are necessary to properly understand the phenomenon and to validate our computational models so that we correctly capture this behaviour in future heat shield designs.\nThe project will pave the way for lighter, reusable heat shields, reducing the cost of space-based technologies.  Research will be shared with international space agencies to facilitate collaboration and accelerate technology development. It will expand the potential for Australian participation in global supply chains and increase our ability to draw significant international funding to address various unsolved challenges posed by future space transport. The project will train its PhD students into the highly skilled scientists desperately needed by Australia’s nascent space industry, and communicating our research through mainstream media will help inspire the brightest young Australians to choose future STEM careers.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Decumulation of retirement savings is challenging to navigate. Without informed strategies, Australian retirees often opt for highly liquid account-based pensions at regulated minimum drawdown rates, exposing themselves to inadequate income, longevity and investment risks which undermine a dignified retirement. To address liquidity challenges, this project devises effective drawdown strategies by disentangling the multi-faceted and evolving needs for individuals as they age. It quantifies the potential implications of alternative phased retirement income solutions and systems on decumulation decisions and their capability of mitigating numerous risks in retirement.\n\nThe project addresses key policy areas of national interest as highlighted in the 2021 Retirement Income Covenant: “increasing the availability of better retirement income products that provide higher incomes and flexibility while also efficiently managing the risks faced by retirees”. Research findings will potentially benefit the entire Australian retirement landscape including regulators, the government, 4.2 million retirees, many more pre-retirees and the superannuation system with combined assets under management of $3.7 trillion. It directly supports The Treasury’s 2023 Discussion Paper on the Retirement Phase of Superannuation, which recommends solutions with longevity protection, forward-planned asset allocation considering retirement phase and income framework enabling collaborations among stakeholders.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Excavation of soils, sands and fragmented rocks is pivotal to two industrial sectors that are essential to Australia’s economy: mining and construction; these yield 15% of the GDP and employ 10% of the national workforce. Current excavation methods are sub-optimal and consume vast amount of expensive and CO2 emitting energy. In finding new energy-efficient excavation methods, the project will cut the energy cost crippling these sectors by billions of dollar per year and avoid the associated emissions of millions of tons per year of CO2 for Australia alone.\nThe resulting gain in productivity will lead to a reduction in the cost of developing Australia’s public infrastructure including roads, airports and tunnels. This is particularly important in the current national context of unprecedented infrastructure development, financed by $75b in taxpayer money this decade. It will also provide a competitive edge to national civil and mining companies, which suffer from $10 billion in excavation-energy related losses every year. These companies represent 20% of the ASX market and contribute to 35% of Australia’s exports. Concurrently, the reduction in CO2 emission will greatly assist Australia in meeting its target on net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nThe CIs routinely collaborate with major national construction and mining companies; this will ideally serve the translation of the research outcomes into new practical excavation methods.",

Managing these adverse impacts is a major challenge for the mining industry, for development of coastal land, and for protection of inland water quality. The proposed project will be of significant national benefit because it will provide strategic new knowledge on aluminium geochemistry for better management of water quality in these economically- and ecologically-important contexts.

With increasing cyber security threats, such as identity theft and data manipulation, data privacy and integrity have become increasingly major concerns for the Australian Government and the public. Recent cyber-attacks and data breaches in Australia have been reported to have an average cost of over USD 4.35 million per breach, representing a 12.7% increase over the past two years. This highlights the necessity of implementing effective privacy-preserving techniques to combat cyber threats and protect national safety, economy, and security, aligning with the Australian Government's Science and Research Priority of \"Cybersecurity\" and National Reconstruction Fund Priority of \" Enabling capabilities\". This project aims to develop easy-to-use security mechanisms and machine learning techniques for data privacy and integrity throughout its lifecycle in the emerging smart critical infrastructure. The knowledge acquired can be utilised by the Australian Government and companies to prevent adversaries from accessing and tampering with the data while ensuring system availability. The project's outcomes can be commercialised for safer and cost-effective critical infrastructure services for Australian essential sectors such as telecommunications, healthcare, and government artificial intelligence-based services, offering opportunities for Australian companies and organisations.",

These technologies allow users to experience completely virtual environments (VR) or merge digital elements with real-world views (AR) and they are rapidly expanding beyond gaming and entertainment into sectors including education, healthcare, manufacturing, engineering, and retail. The versatility and wide applicability of AR/VR offers significant economic and social benefits, but these technologies also have the potential to cause harm, including privacy infringements, harassment, exploitation and discrimination. Our project aims to support proactive policymaking to ensure AR/VR technologies are designed and deployed in a way that is safe and inclusive for all Australians. We address critical knowledge gaps about the corporate interests driving AR/VR innovations and the nature of AR/VR harms, especially for marginalised users. Building on this new knowledge, we will host co-design workshops with policymakers in Australia and Singapore—a major technology hub in the Asia Pacific—to develop public-interest-based regulatory frameworks for AR/VR that are designed to enable public oversight and industry accountability as the field evolves. Given the continued growth of the global AR/VR economy, this project represents a strategic investment in Australia’s digital future.",

This project aims to develop improved electrolytes by combining metal salts, ionic liquids, and diluting molecules to create less viscous, more conductive mixtures while maintaining high ion concentrations in specific areas. We will study the arrangement and movement of ions, ionic liquids, and diluent molecules within the electrolyte using advanced techniques. This molecular-level understanding will help engineer superior electrolytes, leading to batteries with higher energy storage capacity and longer lifetimes. Developing high-performance batteries is crucial for adopting renewable energy sources in both stationary and mobile applications. Longer-lasting batteries will also reduce the environmental impact associated with battery production and disposal. Project outcomes will be communicated to industry via articles and presentations, maximizing understanding and future adoption of this potentially transformative technology. The electrolytes discovered in this project generate new opportunities for local manufacturing and benefit Australian industry, creating opportunities for economic growth and job creation. ",

However, due to the biological complexity of human blood vessels, most of the factors controlling the communication of blood vessel cells within different tissues are yet to be identified. By leveraging and integrating key research strengths in tissue engineering, microvascular biology and biomechanics, this project will deliver new knowledge in how mechanical forces influence organ-specific blood vessel function. By mimicking dynamic interactions within different tissues, this project will allow us to comprehensively characterize how blood vessels transfer signals within tissues, how they function and what may lead to their dysfunction. This project will shape future scientific research and pharmaceutical development across all human organs through a new knowledge framework of specialised organ-specific blood vessel biology and physiology. Future translation of these research outcomes will be of significant value to the medical technologies and pharmaceuticals sector. Our research outputs will be shared with relevant organisations for further validation in mechanistic, diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "In 2022, ChatGPT captured the world’s attention and demonstrated the extraordinary power of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While some claim that GenAI will increase productivity, employee creativity, and on-the-job learning, others warn of complex policy risks, like misinformation and fraud, copyright concerns, inherent bias, and trust issues. There is a significant gap in understanding how GenAI is used in particular social contexts, especially people's creative involvement in producing, maintaining and repurposing it. Using the financial technology sector as a case study, the project addresses these gaps and generates novel insights into the emergence and role of knowledge communities in continuously shaping GenAI as a creative and commercial resource. It will benefit Australia economically, socially, commercially, and culturally by improving the knowledge and skills of citizens and organisations to engage with GenAI productively and safely. Research outcomes will be promoted beyond academia via the national and global media, including press releases and op-ed pieces (e.g., The Conversation), plus ongoing engagement and outreach activities to translate outcomes into impact like podcasts and workshops. Outcomes will be communicated to Australian policymakers, government agencies and corporate stakeholders including finance professionals and peak bodies for translation into discourse and policy.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "In Australia, substantial gender gaps persist in economic outcomes and wellbeing. Gender wage gaps have stagnated since the 1990s, men commit suicide twice as much as women, and gender-based violence remains tragically high, with one in three women a victim of physical or sexual violence, a phenomenon labeled a “national crisis” by PM Albanese in May 2024. Australia and other advanced economies are increasingly recognizing the role of masculinity norms as drivers of these gaps. The National Men’s Health Strategy for 2020-30 acknowledges the intersection between masculinities and public health. In May 2024, Victoria’s state parliament created a Secretary for Men’s Behaviour Change, a new role aimed at reducing violence against women. However, evidence on the role of masculinity norms is currently based on small-scale and localized studies with limited external validity. This project will expand the scope of existing research by collecting the first large-scale, nationally representative, cross cultural data on masculinity norms and understand their relationship to key economic, health, and political outcomes. Our findings will inform policy efforts to benefit men's and boys' well-being, reduce gender inequality, and, ultimately, reduce gender-based violence. We will set up international outreach and dissemination programs by cooperating with international organisations – the World Bank, EBRD, and the OECD-- and national government agencies, such as the Productivity Commission.",

This project will develop the next-generation mathematical theory and computational tools to interpret and analyse DW-MRI signals, surpassing the capabilities of traditional imaging models like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). The highly efficient computational models and tools will establish a mapping between the mathematical model parameters and tissue microstructural properties, potentially leading to more sensitive and specific imaging markers for characterizing brain tissue microstructure. The innovative techniques are poised to not only benefit researchers in applied mathematics, biological mathematics, and biomedical imaging, but also neuroscientists and clinicians. Through publications in high-impact journals, this project will position Australia as a world leader in mathematical modelling with fractional calculus theory and tissue microstructure imaging using DW-MRI. Furthermore, it will foster long-term interdisciplinary collaborations with leading brain imaging centres in Australia and Europe.

This project will address a major knowledge gap by helping us determine how the earliest representatives of our direct ancestor, Homo erectus, managed to survive a changing, more dry world compared to other relatives of contemporary humans and animal species that went extinct. We will take advantage of our teams unique set of recent discoveries; a partial Homo erectus skeleton, our discovered 2-million-year-old skull (the oldest example of this species), and fossils we recovered and believe represent other early human relatives. As well as increasing our understanding of climate adaptation, we aim to highlight the shared ancestry of the multi-cultural society that is Australia and all humans alive today, vital in an increasingly culturally divided world. The project findings will be used to engage the public in science by 3D printing the fossils and using them in outreach programs with Australian schools, as well as making them available to museums throughout the world for educational purposes. Australian students will be able to excavate these fossils on a field school and we will promote the research through media, podcasts and live streams so that people can watch the excavations and learn about the research on their direct ancestor as it progresses.",

The novel process of photothermal catalysis efficiently leverages both the photon energy and heating effect of solar radiation. The reactor design and three crucial chemical reactions, i.e., dry reforming of methane, syngas to methanol, and methanol to olefins, will be optimised to accommodate space operation and Mars settlement. The project will tackle several research gaps, including a solar-driven flow reactor, high-performance photothermal catalyst materials, scalable photothermal catalytic conversion, and the development of strategies for space and Mars applications. The reactor and catalysts developed in this project have the potential to become commercial products, generating economic benefits. The short-term goal of the project is to contribute to decarbonisation efforts, resulting in environmental benefits. This project will be promoted for mid- and long-term objectives that provide insights into the future of human settlement in space and on Mars, offering a sense of security and potential social and cultural benefits for humanity. The research outcomes will be used to engage with industries and government to inform and align with space exploration and settlement strategies. This project may usher in an era of preparing chemical manufacturing for space and Mars.",

This is a critical process during development and wound healing. During epithelial fusion, cells extend finger-like protrusions to make contact and pull each other closer. These protrusions are important for fusion of the neural tube, the precursor to the brain and spinal cord.  However, understanding their functions is limited due to challenges in studying the neural tube live in traditional model animals. Using a unique genetically modified quail model, this research offers unprecedented insights into epithelial fusion in a higher vertebrate. The model enables advanced live imaging to study the dynamic behaviours of cellular protrusions in vivo. The findings will enhance understanding of tissue development and repair, potentially leading to future innovations in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and wound healing, thus improving the quality of life for many Australians. The project will cement Australia’s position as a leader in cell biology and improve workforce capacity in cutting-edge imaging technologies. \nUnderstanding avian embryo development is also vital to the poultry industry. Increasing uniform hatching would yield substantial savings in costs and animal usage.

This project will examine motion vision in the hoverfly, particularly insect target detection, as an innovative model for revealing how sensory input is transformed into behaviour. Indeed, insects with crude optics, small nervous systems and low power requirements manoeuvre with great precision, successfully performing goal-directed behaviour in places they have never encountered. In contrast, autonomous machines struggle with competing inputs and new environments. This project will therefore provide novel understanding of living systems, but it could also provide game-changing upskilling, insights and development for our own technology and robotics. In addition, the project could contribute to agriculture, as hoverflies are important alternative pollinators. This is important as the estimated total value of the pollination service from insects is ~$12Bpa in Australia. As such, this project may benefit Australia in a range of ways including economically, environmentally and socially. The project will include global expertise in robotics, modelling and control theory, and provide Australian-based students and early-career researchers with high-value skills. We will capitalise on our existing experience and networks to pursue public, school student and peer communication avenues for our findings, as well as pathways for potential technology translation.",

This project aims to use state-of-the-art technologies to reveal the process of oxygen release from red blood cells during mechanical force exposure. This project expects to generate new knowledge on a vital biological process originally described using static models of cell-free haemoglobin that do not reflect the diffusive barriers to gas exchange or the mechanical dynamics of the in vivo environment. Expected outcomes include identifying molecular targets responsible for, and equations to accurately describe, the relation between mechanical stress and oxygen transfer. Benefits will include knowledge to improve models of biological dynamics and economic opportunities due to industry applications related to oxygen supply-demand management.",

Classic theory predicts rapid exchange of oxygen between blood and organs, although those approaches relied on measurements in stationary and simplified fluids, which do not translate to the complex and dynamic environment of blood. This project addresses this limitation by developing a cutting-edge method to evaluate how physical forces influence the handling and offloading of oxygen at the single cell resolution and will reveal how the intracellular environment regulates oxygen availability in response to physical forces. The platform technology developed in this project will generate valuable knowledge for future researchers seeking to target specific cellular processes that regulate oxygen transfer from cells, with future applications in health and disease. Further, the developed technology presents commercial opportunities by reducing labour intensive techniques into a single user-friendly platform attractive for blood screening and analytics. The knowledge, technology, and outcomes of this project will thus be shared with, and provide value to, many Australians and is likely to have value in providing tools that may be manufactured locally for export to the world. Knowledge from this project will be shared with community groups via science communication opportunities, and school outreach, to promote science literacy.",

The project aims to investigate the algorithmic models used for advertising on digital platforms. Government and public sector stakeholders are concerned about their market power, privacy, data use, consumer protections and online safety. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Digital Platform Services Inquiry, along with inquiries in Europe and the US, makes clear these problems stem from the limited public oversight and inadequate regulation of the opaque and data-driven advertising model. To create forms of media and online environments that serve all Australians we must first understand the algorithmic advertising model and its ubiquitous role in our everyday lives. This will benefit Australia socially and economically by developing durable ways of making digital media platforms accountable to shared values. Research translation is undertaken with a series of activities to engage with policy makers, industry partners and the public.",

Here, a complex number means a normal real number plus an imaginary number, where imaginary numbers are multiples of the square root of negative one.  There are many fascinating mathematical properties of these complexified models that we shall study with a view to making new mathematical discoveries and, importantly, generating new knowledge about the original real-valued mathematical models and the associated applications.  The project will benefit Australia by enriching applied mathematics as a discipline, positioning Australian researchers at the forefront of contemporary research in this far-reaching topic, and providing a unique research training experience for younger mathematicians.

    "summary": "Translation and Transformation in Late Antiquity. This project offers the first holistic assessment of translation in Late Antiquity, a critically important cultural transformation on par with the introduction of the printing press. It will explore who translated texts, when and why, when the norms for modern European literary analysis were set. It aims to uncover how new translations communicated and shaped knowledge while developing distinct social, political, and cultural groups. It will expand our understanding of the rich variety of Late Antique translation techniques and apply this understanding to how translation methods in modern Australia are changing, including the use of AI technologies, the presence of multi-language communities, and the experience of bilingual speakers.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The study of language translation and transformation will offer social and cultural benefits to Australians dealing with new language norms affected by the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with machine learning capabilities. The new technology makes anonymous translations available to all. These will be characterised by singular iterations of texts in translation that are often not repeatable or verifiable by their users for accuracy. This evolution in technology seems like a boon to a multi-cultural society like Australia, but it will need to be grounded in multi-lingual expertise and user capacity to verify the translations' sources. This project will help language teachers and translators avoid the mistakes of Late Antiquity, when translations misrepresented, reinterpreted, and deliberately altered their source texts in pursuit of specific agenda. As in Late Antiquity, Australia finds itself in a fluid situation thanks to AI, namely that of functional multilingualism which is not based on deep knowledge of the source language. This study will show how lack of literary bilingualism meant that many were reliant on translations whose accuracy could not be measured, providing a template for our own age and culture. The project also builds translation capacity in ancient languages for two doctoral students and will contribute to international efforts to modernise the teaching of ancient languages to accommodate the new translation technologies available to students.",

Taking account of the social and emotional complexities of loneliness, the project will make significant technical advances, developing an AI module that overcomes many of the limitations of currently available AI conversational agents/chatbots. It will develop skilled AI companions capable of attuning to feelings/emotions and of supporting people (24/7) to address the challenges of loneliness within the context of longer-term plans and personal goals. \n\nThese advanced AI companions will have extensive application across the aged-care sector; for (over 1M) older Australians living alone; and for other demographics. The capabilities we will develop will open-up further potential applications in areas such as education, justice, health and social services. Rapid commercialisation/licensing to industry partners will ensure that Australia leads the world in capitalising on the social and economic benefits of developing well targeted, responsible AI solutions to complex social challenges such as loneliness.",

This project aims to address privacy issues in current Open Banking adoption using Bayesian learning techniques that quantitatively analyse privacy risks and propose scenario-based risk mitigation strategies. The expected outcomes include advancing the theoretical knowledge base in privacy risk assessment and mitigation for open finance, and new guidelines for establishing explicit and well-informed consumer consent in digital financial service platforms. The project findings are expected to significantly enhance ethical and responsible digital financial service offerings, strengthen consumers' privacy awareness and well-grained data controls, and foster the development of privacy regulation in digital finance and the open data economy.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Open banking - an innovative and legislated financial services practice that gives consumers the option of sharing their bank data with accredited third parties, has the potential to revolutionise the financial sector by fostering innovation and prioritising customer-centric solutions. However, open banking has not been widely adopted in Australia and abroad due to privacy and security risks. While informed consumer consent holds promise in addressing this issue by empowering consumers with data control, clear guidance for consumers on how to effectively implement consent mechanisms is commonly lacking. This project aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging cutting-edge AI-driven data analytic techniques to explicitly quantify potential privacy risks associated with personal bank data sharing, alongside the formulation of risk mitigation strategies that empower consumers to provide privacy-preserving bank data sharing consent. The outcomes will promote ethical digital transformation in the Australian financial industry, enhance consumer privacy awareness and education when using digital financial services and products, and inform regulatory and legal framework design regarding privacy risk disclosure and consumer information provision standards in the development of digital and open finance. The project findings will be widely communicated among financial industry and regulators to facilitate its practical use. ",

The project aims to investigate the history, legality and modern implications of police collecting of Indigenous Ancestral Remains and cultural property and the role of museums and governments in directing this activity (1825-1930). By examining relevant law and jurisprudence during this period, and assumptions about applicability to Indigenous ownership and enjoyment of their possessions, we expect to generate new knowledge of the legal bases on which resulting museum collections rely. Expected outcomes include new histories about police-collecting and their legal, social and political implications, benefitting repatriation, truth-telling and reconciliation, and decolonised heritage legislation and museum policies here and overseas.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "It is increasingly well known that police perpetrated violence against First Nations throughout the colonial period. But their role in supplying human remains and cultural objects to domestic and overseas museums is little understood, nor whether they exceeded or abused their powers in doing so. Combining fine-grained historical research with detailed legal analysis, this project investigates police collecting (1825-1930) and its contemporary implications. Revealing this history is of profound importance to First Nations seeking to know what happened to their Ancestors and cultural property, self-determine their future, and make repatriation claims. It is also of deep importance to museums and police, as understanding and acknowledging their past colonial actions will improve service to First Nations and is critical for their reconciliation aspirations. Findings in diverse formats will maximise reach and uptake: a book and journal articles; education materials; conference papers and a symposium; submissions to museums and their peak bodies, to police organisations, government, treaty and truth telling processes, and to social justice commissions and enquiries. Findings will also be made available to First Nations via the Return Reconcile Renew Digital Archive and peak organisations whose experts are on the project reference group. The use of project insights will contribute to repatriation, reconciliation and associated improved social outcomes for First Nation Australians.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project aims to assist Australian rental households by identifying the support requirements of tenants undergoing relocation and suggesting strategies to reduce the adverse effects of moving and rebuilding their lives. Over one quarter of Australian households reside in privately rented homes. Rising rental costs place considerable financial strain on these households and many are forced to move to more affordable housing options across suburbs, cities, or even regions. There is a lack of understanding regarding the challenges faced during this time with the process often separating established family groups, friends, community ties, and available job opportunities. The resulting community impact alters workforce availability and necessitates changes in infrastructure and services both in the original and new locations. The research aims to benefit Australians socially and economically by assessing how these relocations affect the demand for community infrastructure and services. Insights will be disseminated to households through various channels including a social media animation and an online exhibition. These findings will be communicated to policymakers to help address these issues, as well as industry stakeholders, and service providers through a comprehensive report and an industry summit.",

This project aims to investigate the value of the handmade within fashion and textile ecosystems in two Australian states. This project expects to generate new knowledge in the area of circular economy by using place-based approaches to foreground experiences of small businesses and craft communities that are typically excluded from the industrial view of a circular economy. Expected outcomes of the project include understanding and defining new forms of value within a fashion and textiles circular economy through surfacing the local economies of making, reuse and remaking. This should provide significant benefits, such as informing new strategies to reduce textile waste and contributing to Australia’s transition to a circular economy.",

Slowing down production and consumption through the circular economy approaches of reuse, repair and remake can help to reduce the use of new resources and the generation of waste. This project explores handmaking practices within two Australian states centring on small-scale industry, domestic and community settings. The aim is to understand the social, environmental and economic value of the handmade and how an understanding of its value can support the transition to a local circular economy, while generating wellbeing and social cohesion. It seeks to address a critical gap in circular economy thinking, which is the role of craft and the handmade in slowing the demand for new materials. Economically, the promotion of handmade practices could stimulate local economies by supporting small-scale businesses and artisans. Socially, it can foster community resilience and promote a sense of cultural identity through the preservation of craft knowledge. Environmentally, this research can lead to a reduction in textile waste and pollution. These outcomes will be communicated through workshops with the fashion industry and broader community, publications and a repository capturing handmaking knowledge to enable the translation to a circular economy.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "In many physical systems, an interface changes over time in a way dependent on its curvature. Examples include erosion processes like stones tumbling on the beach and the propagation of bushfire fronts. Often these evolutionary processes are highly nonlinear. This project addresses the research gap in the mathematical understanding of fully nonlinear evolution by curvature. Better mathematical understanding of these processes developed in this project could lead to improvements in applications such as bushfire modelling, of critical significance in Australia. Research outcomes could be promoted beyond academia to organisations that rely on these or related models, so they can make adjustments to their operations with potential economic, environmental and health benefits. Graduates and early career researchers from the research training element of this program could be directly placed into jobs with such organisations to realise this research translation. The Administering Institution has a well-established team ready to assist with research translation by connecting these researchers with users in bushfire modelling and in other practical applications.",

This project will investigate the ways that women have contributed to the story of slang in the past in Australia, through collecting, recording, engaging with, or writing about colloquial language. In doing so, the project will reveal previously unknown stories about how women have used slang, and ideas about slang, to both shape and express their identities, and to assert themselves within the nation’s culture and story. Through public lectures, podcasts, short newspaper and online articles, and a book, the project will provide the Australian community with important knowledge and insights into the story of women and slang that will shed light on the parts women have played in this aspect of national identity and culture, which, in turn, will help foster a more inclusive sense of national identity.",

It ensures a sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients to active brain regions, supporting cognitive abilities, sleep patterns, memory formation, and sensory processing in every Australian, every day. However, despite its critical importance, this intricate mechanism remains poorly understood, especially within the deeper structures of the brain. Our project seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a minimally invasive endoscope equipped with advanced imaging modalities, enabling us to directly observe and investigate neurovascular coupling in these previously inaccessible brain regions. The project has the potential to solidify Australia's position at the forefront of neurotechnology, a rapidly growing field attracting significant venture capital investment. Partnerships with DeepEn, a leading German endoscope manufacturer, and Cylite, an established Australian imaging device manufacturer, will drive commercialisation efforts for this technology. In the future and beyond the scope of the project, the enhanced understanding of neurovascular coupling enabled by our technology holds immense potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases, such as dementia and stroke, ultimately improving the quality of life for millions of Australians.",

This will help accurate modelling of marine nutrient cycles and support practical advances in sulfur nutrition. Australia’s vast marine jurisdiction spans over 8 million square kilometers and supports a thriving ‘blue economy’ of >400,000 jobs with > $100 billion annual revenue. Identification of the breakdown pathways for organosulfur will lead to the discovery of new biological catalysts with strong commercial potential for the Australian biotechnology sector. Additionally, it will inform microbe bioengineering strategies to reduce reliance on synthetic sulfur-based fertilizers, supporting sustainable agri/aquacultural practices.

Recent work from us and others suggests that they may also have important roles in how viruses can cause disease. However, how they contribute to viral function is unclear. In this project we will identify the function of proteins in viruses that cause significant problems for Australia’s agriculture and healthcare systems. These viruses affect poultry and cattle, resulting in $5.5 billion costs due to animal losses, resulting in enormous socioeconomic and healthcare costs. As well as generating understanding of the role of these proteins in viruses, the project outcomes will pave the way for the future development of better treatment options for these viruses and assist to reduce the socioeconomically burden. We will also develop new materials for the simple, low-cost detection of these proteins, solving a long-standing challenge. We will use our extensive experience and connections in the biotechnology sector to maximise future opportunities to convert these materials into commercial diagnostic products. Our preliminary work has generated significant media attention and relationships with journalists at major Australian institutions (e.g. The Age, SBS, ABC) will be maintained to maximise public dissemination of project outcomes.",

However, a major roadblock is that hydrogen can make metallic infrastructure brittle and potentially fail. In this project we will break this complicated problem down by determining the individual responses of the different micro-scale components of alloys when deformed in the presence of hydrogen. We can then predict how these components will influence the overall alloy behaviour, allowing the design of future alloys alloys with favourable structures. We will achieve this by utilising new advanced microscopy techniques pioneered in our lab and a modern approach to modelling hydrogen behaviour that combines density functional theory and machine learning. This comprehensive, first of its kind study will result in new knowledge and new analysis methods that will be useful for researchers designing new durable metal alloys that are less susceptible to embrittlement and can be used for the safe generation, storage, and transportation of hydrogen. In the long term, success with this project will ensure that Australia is able to receive the substantial economic and environmental benefits of this clean energy source.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Long-term commercial impact of fundamental mathematics research is common, but the specifics are difficult to predict. It typically arises through the development of new technologies based on the use of mathematical concepts in other disciplines. This project will discover new models for noncommutative phenomena, at the frontier of the study of operator algebras, which underpin quantum mechanics - the physics that made possible the development of the transistors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from which devices like the one on which you are probably reading this text are built. Impact also arises through mathematically skilled individuals going on to work in industry and the public sector, and helping demonstrate the significant benefits of mathematical research. At least five of the investigators' PhD graduates currently work in Australian government agencies, driving policy; at least six more contribute to economic activity in the finance, green tech, data science and security sectors. Others are now internationally-based researchers, contributing to Australia's collaborative network. This project supports world-leading research, expands Australia's knowledge base in mathematics, and fosters Australian international competitiveness. Its capacity-building aspects will train individuals who will enhance Australia's international reputation, our ability to make data-driven decisions, and our economy more broadly.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project addresses the question of how cellular membrane proteins – in particular, pumps for the cross-membrane transport of key ions – are controlled at a molecular level. These pumps determine such fundamental processes as nerve function, muscle contraction and digestion, and constitute a sizeable proportion of all drug targets. While major progress has been made in revealing the structure of specific ion pumps, the puzzle is still incomplete and we do not yet know how the pumps actually work in a living organism. This is a key knowledge gap, which if tackled, will feed into structure-activity studies for new drugs. With drug resistance an ever-increasing problem, the identification of new drug targets is of vital importance and future benefit to Australia. Using a frontier recording instrument that is the only one of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, this project aims to break through the current difficulties in measuring pump molecular interactions with the cell membrane, and thus complete the puzzle . Our success in delivering a holistic understanding of both the ion pumps and their surrounding membrane (without which the pumps cannot function) would make Australia a focus of global research attention. Major conferences and meetings and a broader media presence will ensure wide dissemination of our findings. World-class training for Australian early career scholars at the exciting interface of biology, chemistry and physics is a further beneficial project outcome.",

The intricate mathematical structure underlying string theory remains unsettled. The goal of this project is to resolve open questions about this structure and provide new knowledge within both physics and mathematics. There are string theory research groups at universities worldwide, but it is still a developing field in Australia. This project is an opportunity to bring world-leading figures into our sphere of influence, fostering young Australian talent. It will also bring us closer to realising real-world applications of these theories, such as advanced materials design and quantum computing, which will provide commercial and economic benefits for Australian industries. There is already a strong interest in string theory in the general public, and we intend to capitalise on this by promoting our results beyond academia via activities such as public lectures. This will provide additional cultural and societal benefits in fostering a love of fundamental science among Australians.",

Considering different interconnection topologies and different types of missions (e.g. consensus, randezvous), this project will exploit the stability of the closed-loop system in order to obtain better near-optimality.  Expected outcomes include novel distributed near-optimal control algorithms, whose performance, stability and robustness will be investigated in detail. As multi agent systems is a critical enabling technology spanning all sectors, significant benefits are expected, including enhanced control and monitoring for important classes of complex systems, including those arising in collaborative robotics and smart grid.",

Such ground-breaking technology has transformative implications across many sectors. This research will enhance the design of these multi-agent systems by developing a design methodology for highly effective and robust control algorithms. These algorithms will substantially improve the performance, stability and robustness of multi-agent systems while carefully navigating the inherent design trade-offs. We will accelerate translation of this research through our existing industry and government contacts, as well as workshops, seminars, and media articles.

Many East Antarctic glacier systems that are vulnerable to ice loss lie within the expanse of Australian Antarctic Territory. A critical gap exists in our current knowledge, because until now it was not possible to conduct the needed observations across such vast and remote areas.\n\nThis project will establish an innovative and world-leading capability to understand and monitor change in the outlet glacier systems of East Antarctica. The team will use seismic recordings of icequakes and apply machine learning to interrogate these sudden vibrations due to moving ice, melt water, and ocean wave action. Environmental benefits include better predictions of accelerated sea level rise. Social and commercial benefits include informing actions to mitigate the impact of sea level rise on Australia’s coastal communities and infrastructure.\n\nNew knowledge outcomes, presented in summary form as time-evolving animations, will communicate how each glacier system is responding to influences such as the warming ocean. The new monitoring capability outcome, promoted through the global network of national Antarctic programs, will demonstrate Australia’s stewardship of the extensive East Antarctic region.  Further promotion of the many transferable workflows to geotechnical industry networks will enable future workforce development in skills areas that are needed in a rapidly changing world.\n",

This technology promises to greatly reduce the size, weight, cost, and energy consumption of power systems by increasing both power density and conversion efficiency at the device level. However, its limited thermal conductivity poses a significant challenge for widespread use in power electronics.\n\nThis project aims to overcome the primary limitation of Ga2O3—its low thermal conductivity—by using a high-throughput manufacturing approach. The resulting ultrathin freestanding membrane is designed to enable innovative architectural designs, addressing the challenge of low thermal conductivity and expanding the potential applications of Ga2O3.

    "summary": "Understanding avian innate immunity to improve avian influenza surveillance. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) threatens Australian livestock and wild animal populations. Aberrant innate immune responses cause tissue damage in susceptible, but not tolerant species. This project will reveal the molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune signalling differences between HPAIV-susceptible (chicken) and tolerant (duck) species. This project will also determine if these differences in innate immune signalling are conserved in predicted HPAIV-susceptible and tolerant wild bird species. Expected outcomes include novel insights into avian immunology and innate immune signalling and new strategies to predict species susceptibility to HPAIV for significant agricultural, conservation and biosecurity benefits.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Emerging viruses, like highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAIV), cause severe disease and death in domestic poultry livestock and wild birds. Some species, such as ducks, can carry HPAIV with minimal disease, meaning they can easily spread viruses. The immune response is the best protection against viral infection, yet in HPAIV-susceptible species (such as chickens), immune overactivation may cause collateral tissue damage, driving disease. We have identified an immune pathway that is overactive in chickens compared with ducks. This research project will uncover why this immune pathway is overactive in chickens but not ducks and whether this immune pathway is also overactive in native Australian birds.  With this knowledge, we can better predict which native birds may act as HPAIV carriers (like ducks) and which birds are at high risk of death (like chickens). Our findings will improve HPAIV surveillance and Australian biosecurity to protect our poultry and livestock industries and our wild birds. This research proposal will also generate fundamental new knowledge about how this immune pathway functions in infection, which we anticipate may also generate new intellectual property. The project will employ and train Australian scientists in immunology and increasing their employability in academia, industry and government. Project outcomes will be published in open-access journals and will be shared with government (e.g. Biosecurity QLD), wildlife organisations and industry.",

    "summary": "Closing the gap between integrable models and branching processes. Integrable stochastic lattice models are highly effective for the study of universal phenomena in transport, directed polymers and interface dynamics. This project aims to address a key knowledge gap by developing and studying new integrable models for processes that (i) do not obey particle conservation and (ii) display population-dependent branching mechanisms such as in realistic reproduction dynamics. Such models are mathematically tractable and, as a result, the project will lead to a deeper understanding of key processes such as those that regulate bacterial colonies and proliferating cancer cells, and provide new insights into how interdependence and heterogeneity of individuals affects the late time behaviour of growing populations.",

Integrable vertex models are crucial for understanding complex systems, while branching processes are pivotal in mathematical modelling. Linking these areas will push the boundaries of mathematical sciences, leading to new insights and methodologies – many of which will have real-world applications. For instance, better understanding of branching processes will improve models used in epidemiology for predicting disease spread, and in environmental science for predicting forest fires and assessing climate change impacts, providing social and environmental benefits for Australia. The researchers trained in these discoveries will be well-prepared for careers in academia, industry, and government sectors, enhancing our workforce in critical STEM areas and providing economic benefits for Australia, as well as positioning our country as a global scientific leader. The mathematical tools developed will be made freely available through open-access repositories and libraries. ",

We carry computers in our pockets that are more powerful than those which filled entire rooms just fifty years ago. The next step towards faster and lower-energy computer chips is to shrink the size of electronic circuits even further – to the size of single molecules (50,000 times smaller than the width of a hair). In this project, we will build a toolkit of molecule-scale electronics and create design rules for better materials. Through partnerships with users and IP licensing, this research will contribute to the Australian advanced manufacturing sector and will help to establish an onshore semiconductor industry (current global value: $860bn). For the Australian community, our research will underpin the electronic devices of the future, with uses from energy storage (e.g., improved batteries), to miniature sensors (e.g., wearable devices), and computing (e.g., faster processing).",

This project explores the use of high frequency sound waves to markedly increase the production efficiency of hydrogen fuel generation while using cheaper platinum-free electrode materials. The project outcomes will strengthen green hydrogen and ammonia production technologies, with the potential to enhance Australia’s clean energy output and strengthen the nation’s contributions in carbon dioxide emission reduction through new investment opportunities and job creation. Cleaner energy production will reduce Australia’s reliance on burning fossil fuels, which is a major source of pollution, and potentially mitigate catastrophic environmental consequences of climate change. The project outcomes extend far beyond scientific breakthrough discoveries utilising the novel use of high frequency sound waves to dramatically enhance catalysis for green hydrogen and ammonia production and will facilitate translation into building efficient and low-cost hydrogen generators. We will promote the outcomes of this project through the media team to attract industry partners to co-develop our acoustic platform into viable prototypes for green energy. This, in turn, will accelerate Australia’s use of renewable and clean energy in the electricity market, which currently accounts for only 32.5% of the total market, compared to 67.5% produced through fossil fuels.",

This project aims to discover new, high performing, versatile, safe lubricants to replace current PFC-based products that are toxic to humans and detrimental to the environment, and for which there are currently no viable replacements. We aim to not only replace current toxic lubricants; By combining cutting edge experimental techniques to understand how molecules and ions assemble into lubricating layers, we will design new materials that more effectively dissipate friction and can recover from damage. Unlike molecular-based lubricants, using ionic liquids enables them to function for longer times and under extremes of temperature and pressure without evaporating, also reducing the environmental and economic impact of wear-and-tear. The novel lubricant technologies discovered in this project are expected to generate opportunities for local manufacturing and benefit Australian industry, yielding opportunities for economic growth and job creation.",

Yet, specific and broader applications of lipid nanoparticles are limited by the poor understanding of their interactions with biological systems and the difficulty in controlling their internal structure and composition, all of which determine their function and performance. We will develop a library of a new class of lipid nanoparticles engineered with tuneable internal structure and composition, and then explore their behaviour in biological environments. The design rules for engineering these novel lipid nanoparticles and their biological interactions will be informed through computer simulations. We will promote our results through publications and seminars. Licensing of intellectual property will support the translation and commercialisation of these engineered lipid nanoparticles. We will explore commercialisation opportunities to spin out new technologies. This research will benefit Australia economically, commercially, and environmentally through the development of high-value materials for the future benefit of the Australian agriculture, food, and biomedical sectors by contributing to improved crop productivity, nutrient uptake, food shelf life, and therapeutic delivery.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Why do females live longer than males but are paradoxically more susceptible to age-related muscle loss? By 2053, 10 million Australians will be aged over 65 years and the majority will be female. We hypothesize that sex hormones and sex chromosomes can independently affect the progression and consequences of age-related muscle loss, yet the origins of these differences are unknown as our current knowledge overwhelmingly comes from findings from male cohorts. This project will start to address this knowledge gap by examining the cause-and-effect relationships between molecular regulators and age- and sex-specific traits in skeletal muscle loss. The novel fundamental knowledge generated will not only be valuable for all pre-clinical research into age-related muscle loss, but also inform the development of future interventions to promote healthy ageing in Australian males and females. Our team is ideally placed to build research capacity in this space, in Australia and internationally, and to communicate our results to industry groups, policymakers and health professionals interacting with ageing Australians, ensuring rapid and effective translation. Improving healthy ageing is an Australian research priority. By paving the way to sex-specific anti-ageing interventions, this project will deliver economic and social benefit for Australians and ensure that future research accounts for the largest segment of our ageing population.

Bunya pines, iconic conifers that hold special significance to First Nations communities and Australia’s biodiversity, are seriously threatened due to dieback caused by introduced pathogens known as Phytophthora spp. Using cutting-edge DNA sequencing, the project will decode the genomes of the Bunya pines and Phytophthora spp. to investigate genes and molecular pathways associated with disease development and resistance. The expected outcomes are molecular methods to identify dieback-resistant plants for regeneration purposes; rapid disease diagnostics; and pathogen monitoring. The key benefits are to protect Australia’s biodiversity from invasive pathogens and to maintain cultural heritage values. ",

However, these majestic trees and ‘living fossils’ are rapidly declining due to a disease known as dieback or root rot. Most likely, this is a new disease caused by microbial pathogens that were recently introduced to Australia. Currently, chemical treatment of infected trees is the only solution put forward for disease management. This project will provide a new, long-term, and environmentally sound solution using cutting-edge DNA-based technologies that will identify disease resistance in Bunya pines. Subsequently, the project will develop DNA markers to quickly recognise those young trees in nurseries that are resistant to the disease and, therefore, should be used for reforestation. This new approach will be developed to be applicable for commercially important trees that are also attacked by this disease, particularly hoop pines, in follow-up forestry projects. The project will demonstrate the value of advanced DNA technologies in the sustainable management of serious tree diseases. It will deliver a new solution to conserve Australia’s unique ecosystem and safeguard the economy and Indigenous cultural values.",

However, a major hurdle in neuroimaging research is its reproducibility—the ability to achieve consistent results using the same data and methods in repeated experiments. This reproducibility is essential for scientists to verify findings, stand on the shoulders of giants, and drive forward with new discoveries.\n \nOur project aims to investigate reproducibility practices, develop methodologies that enable analytical reproducibility, and identify how these can be disseminated to and adopted by the neuroimaging community. This understanding will lead to new analysis standards that enable scientists to reliably reproduce, validate, and build upon each other's work, significantly accelerating progress in neuroimaging research.\n \nThese outcomes will bolster Australia's reputation as a leader in open science and neuroimaging, fostering international collaborations and attracting future investments. Additionally, our project will enhance Australia's neuroimaging infrastructure and standards development capabilities. We will share our findings through academic publications, workshops, and conferences, publish our standards to encourage community involvement, and integrate our solutions into established analysis platforms to directly benefit researchers.\n",

This proposal aims to identify for the first time, the different patterns of activity along the length of the gut in freely moving animals in their natural environment. This will be accomplished using miniature fully implantable wireless devices developed and tested by the investigators. The project expects to generate – without the constraints of current recording methods – crucial new knowledge about gut function in the body including which patterns of gut activity are controlled by the peripheral nervous system and how gut activity is modified during environmental changes. This will provide major benefits by delivering breakthrough technology and new knowledge to global science; placing Australia at the forefront of gut research.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Currently, our fundamental understanding of how the gastrointestinal (GI) tract functions in the body is limited; primarily because there has been no technology available to record GI-tract activity in living animals that are awake and free to move in their environment (versus being restrained or anesthetized: a key problem since both strongly affect the GI-tract). This project will demonstrate a breakthrough technology which will allow long-term recordings from all regions of the GI-tract in laboratory animals that are awake and free to move around. To do this, we will use a new miniature device developed by the applicant team. The device is implanted in the body and uses wireless Bluetooth technology to record gut activity. This means we can, for the first time, understand what patterns of activity occur in the GI-tract during normal behaviours like feeding, drinking, sleeping and socialising with other animals, and shed light on dysfunctional patterns of GI activity when disorders occur. This project will also reveal how the GI-tract is affected by changes to day-night cycles and identify mechanisms that cause the patterns of activity. The research findings, to be disseminated via scholarly fora and wide-ranging public media, would pave the way for future economic, commercial and social benefits for Australia by providing innovative basic knowledge of gut function and a major new (potentially commercialisable) bioelectronic recording technology for biomedical science.

City life in Australia has historically benefited from its access to nearshore marine environments, but it has also degraded and harmed those environments. Yet we know little about the history of the relationship of cities, urban processes, and marine environments. This project aims to understand how urban residents, governments, and institutions have developed, managed, and thought about relationships between cities and marine environments since settlement. Through its analysis of social and political developments this project promises significant new knowledge to benefit both human and environmental needs within cities. It will benefit current and emerging government initiatives to promote marine and coastal sustainability, particularly in urban zones. The project promises cultural benefits for Australians by recovering forgotten stories and recording community memories and practices as a basis for ongoing place attachment, environmental knowledge, and community building and resilience. Research findings will emerge not only from archives and other visual and material records but also from engagement with individuals, community groups and policy makers, who will benefit from telling their stories and generating policy relevant research questions.",

Ensuring that forecasts of disaggregate data add up to the forecast of aggregate data is critical to ensure that decisions are aligned across the organisation. The project will develop new methods for forecasting that inform decisions to minimise economic costs in an uncertain environment. The research will lead to economic benefits via management of inventories, planning, and risk management reducing costs for businesses and government organisations, across industries including retail, finance and energy. In the case of energy, environmental benefits will also be realised via a more cost effective transition to zero carbon electricity generation. With its emphasis on economic costs, the project will improve forecasting methods already used widely in industry. This existing translation of research into practice has been a consequence of the direct efforts of the researchers, and their development of freely available software implementations of their forecasting methods. Through these established links with industry, as well as a continued commitment to open source software, the new research outcomes of this project have a high likelihood of adoption by the broader Australian and international community.",

These lightweight polymers will enable Australian manufacturers to design devices for electronics, semiconductors, insulators, soft actuators, smart textiles, energy storage, biosensors, and biomedicine. We will develop a scalable process for creating flexible-robust-conductive films, giving Australia a competitive edge in the global market for advanced materials & electronics. This will strengthen Australia's economy and reinforce its position as a leader in technology-driven industries. We will create proprietary technology products with projected annual market value of $50 billion, positioning Australia to revolutionize industries like electrostatic coatings, flexible electronics, bioelectronics, energy storage, actuators, & biosensors and capitalize on new market opportunities. This opens avenues for extensive applications, particularly in portable biosensors for rapid biomarker detection in vital sectors like medicine, food, environment, and agriculture. It stimulates economic growth, creates jobs, and diversifies industries. By this new conductive polymers, Australia will secure its position as a global leader in advanced materials and pave the way for sustained prosperity in the 21st century.\n",

Using this rich case study of a period and region of great technological, social, and religious upheaval, we will provide a better understanding of the sociality of nighttime activities and a new cultural history of the period that gives agency to marginalised groups. The project will thus not only enhance our knowledge of the complexities of ancient societies and provide lessons for the present in better understanding patterns of violence, religious observance, storytelling, and the mechanisms of social cohesion. Collaborations with key industry partners, including Stromlo Observatory (ACT) and the Immigration Museum (VIC), will provide benefits in heritage access, cultural education, and community inclusion and wellbeing. Benefits for the field include new knowledge, innovative methods, and capacity development for PhDs, including modelling of best practice interdisciplinary work with cultural and scientific organisations.

This project aims to understand what drives brain development leading to variability in socioemotional functioning in adolescence. Adolescence is a dynamic developmental window for brain development, and current models of adolescent development fail to predict why, when and to whom, changes lead to socioemotional difficulties and poorer outcomes. Timing and progression of puberty is emerging as a better marker of where an adolescents’ brain is up to in development. Having established the largest internationally collaborative dataset, this project will reveal the role of pubertal maturation and hormones in adolescent brain development, with significant beneficial consequences for age-based benchmarking decisions in policy and society.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Adolescence is one of the riskiest times to be human. Changes in developing brains of young people can lead to socioemotional difficulties and poor outcomes, like reckless driving, assaults, unsafe sex, substance use and self-harm. Current models of adolescent development fail to predict why, when and to whom, changes lead to socioemotional difficulties and poor outcomes. However, the timing and progression of puberty is emerging as a better marker of where an adolescents’ brain is up to in development. This project focuses on understanding the drivers and timings of brain development, and the role of pubertal maturation and hormones. This will have implications for how we benchmark brain development across adolescence at population levels, and provides opportunities to have a positive impact on developmental trajectories relating to health, education, and social success across the lifespan. This project will strengthen Australia as the hub of an international, collaborative, open-access dataset on adolescent brain development, available for researchers to access worldwide with ongoing capacity to help answer key questions about adolescence brains. To enable the translation of evidence-based knowledge, results will be promoted to parents, health and education professionals, and policy makers across Australia and internationally. The implications span science, education, policy- and law-making and may influence how legal competency and educational levels are measured. ",

These technologies are provoking rupture and change - and through this project we have the opportunity to positively influence engagement with GenAI technologies in the academic writing and publishing sector. Our research is timely and vital for Australia because it investigates how academic practices that are supported by GenAI technologies can continue to meet high quality standards, essential for maintaining Australia’s reputation for academic excellence and contributing to Australia’s socio-economic competitive advancement. The project supports innovation and efficiency in scholarship, keeping Australia’s academic institutions at the forefront of technological integration. We will share our findings beyond academic circles through policy reports and briefs to influence the publishing industry and governmental approaches to GenAI in scholarly settings. We will use media channels to raise awareness about this important issue within the broader community and stimulate public discussion for a well-informed community equipped to navigate the complexities of GenAI in academia and ensure research quality that benefits all Australians.",

    "summary": "Cracking the Code: Parent Influences on Adolescent Daily Coping with Stress. This project aims to answer vital questions scientists and parents face as adolescents turn to a modern digital toolbox to cope with growing challenges. By advancing a novel theory-based framework, the project expects to generate new knowledge for parents, helping teens to make the most of opportunities and reduce risk. The project combines a nationwide survey of parents with high-resolution insights into parent and teen daily life via novel data collected from smartphones. Expected outcomes include advancement of a new theory of parenting to support teens and refined methods for addressing parent and teen daily experiences. This should provide significant benefits to building health and wellbeing of Australian adolescents and caregivers.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Over 1/3 of Australian adolescents feel that they cannot cope effectively with their stress. At the same time, teens are increasingly turning to digital tools, platforms, and social media in an attempt to cope with their stressors (for example, going online to connect with supports or find information to better respond to a stressor); yet parents report feeling ill-equipped to support them in this endeavour. Despite the magnitude of these issues, research is yet to identity how parents can best support their adolescent’s coping success and safety in this digital arena. This project addresses a critical gap in science and policy and will directly benefit Australian teenagers and their families by (a) identifying the optimal digital strategies adolescents can use in the face of stress, as well as (b) the modifiable behaviours that parents can adopt to support their teen’s healthy digital coping to enhance teen’s wellbeing and buffer them from mental health problems. These strategies will be communicated through community feedback sessions, media, and incorporated into existing and new parenting interventions and supports. Findings will have direct relevance to informing national policy discussions around adolescents’ use of digital platforms including on reducing harms (i.e. social media bans for teens) and mental health policy aiming to reduce burden of mental health in Australia.

To address this gap, the project will develop a gamified 3D cultural heritage platform to make archaeological and architectural heritage accessible and interactive. Technologies including artificial intelligence and 3D interactive modelling will create immersive, educational experiences that engage the public with historical narratives. \nThis platform will deliver multiple benefits. Economically, the cultural tourism sector will be enhanced by enriching visitor engagement with innovative storytelling and exhibition tools. Socially, Australia’s national identity and civic pride will be strengthened by making cultural heritage more accessible and engaging. Environmentally, the digitalisation approach will protect archaeological sites and built heritage, preserving these critical and non-renewable assets for future generations. \nThe project will collaborate with cultural and educational institutions to maximise outcomes beyond academia, promoting the platform’s use in public education programs and exhibitions. Targeted workshops and a website with open-source tools will facilitate its adoption, contributing significantly to national and cultural discourse. Aligning with broader national interests, this project positions the platform as a pioneer in digital cultural preservation and educational innovation.",

Detecting and characterising earth like planets are the most significant goal to answer these questions. Based on micron-scale processing of transparent material, this project will develop and enhanced the ability for future space missions to detect emission such as thermal radiation from Earth-like exoplanets. In obtaining critical informations on atmospheres, sign of oxygen and water, and habitability, this method will allow the understanding on how secondary atmospheres like that of Earth’s form and when. The project will reinforce Australia's position in space exploration and generate broad society impacts with the introduction of new advanced detection devices, paving the way towards commercializing of photonic devices operating at thermal infrared wavelengths with improved opportunities for sensing. The developed technology will provide essential insights about one of humanity’s grandest goals, crossing several fields of science and philosophy – determining our place in the Universe through both finding how common planets with potentially life-supporting atmospheres are, and even if there is life on other planets.",

These alternative RNAs make different proteins (isoforms) that are presumed to have different functions within a cell. However, the functions of most of these protein isoforms remain a mystery. This project aims to capitalise on advances in gene editing technology to determine the functional consequences of alternative splicing. It is expected to reveal functions of protein isoforms that are essential for cell growth, movement, and cell state transitions. We anticipate use of this technology could facilitate better understanding of human development, future treatments, and improvements in agricultural applications.",

In humans, the complex functions of cells require many different proteins (isoforms) to be made from a limited number of genes by a process called alternative RNA splicing. While alternative splicing is critical for normal cell behaviour, the functions of most protein isoforms arising from alternative splicing remain a mystery. This project will leverage new technology to assess the functions of hundreds of protein isoforms and identify how they operate to promote cell growth, movement, and transitions between cell states. It will contribute fundamental knowledge to our understanding of the functional complexity of the human genome. These findings could be directly applied and benefit many cell engineering applications in the areas of development and disease. These benefits could extend to future improvements in agricultural applications in Australia and beyond through splicing manipulation of crops, livestock and microorganisms. Collaboration with Australia’s new RNA manufacturing sector will enable translation and benefit to these agricultural, health and biotechnology industries.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The future health of Australia’s marine ecosystems, from its tropical coral reefs to its Antarctic territorial waters, will depend on the ability of species to adapt as ocean temperatures continue to rise as a result of climate change. Developing marine management strategies that protect and enhance the ability of species to adapt is critical to preserving the immense economic, environmental and cultural value that these ecosystems provide to Australians. Genetic variation must be at the core of any such strategies because it is the fundamental fuel of adaptation and an excellent predictor of adaptive capacity. The goal of this research proposal is to understand an important component of genetic variation that has so far remained hidden in rearrangements of genomes. Human interventions, such as assisted gene flow, are already occurring in an attempt to increase marine species ability to adapt. Such interventions can lead to unintended consequences and may accelerate declines without adequate understanding of these genomic rearrangements. This research will help inform management interventions designed to help species adapt to climate change. This will provide environmental benefits and will also help ensure conservation funds are spent wisely.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The increased functionality and miniaturization of modern devices demands higher energy density and better efficiency of energy storage than the state-of-the-art. Ceramic thin-film capacitors have emerged as ultrafast charge-discharge miniaturized sources, compared with batteries and fuel cells. However, the energy density enhancement of current thin-film capacitors still relies on the application of intensely strong electric fields, which incur concerns over reduced reliability and shorter lifetime. This project aims to develop novel ‘thin-film materials’ with ultrahigh energy density and ultrafast operation under low electric field, which not only meet the requirements for integration and miniaturization, but also greatly improve the reliability and operational performance of advanced electronic systems. The project will underpin Australia’s leadership and competitive edge in next-generation energy storage technology. The pursuit of such ground-breaking discoveries in thin-film materials aligns with national interest in Advanced Energy Storage, which was set out as a priority by the Australian Government in National Science and Research Priorities. Through partnership and the licensing of IP, these new materials will add a critical technology into the global ceramic thin-film capacitors industry ($2.6b by 2026), and have potential application across numerous Australian industry sectors, from electric vehicles to renewable energy and medical devices to defence and aerospace.",

Grains, including sorghum, wheat and barley, are the second most profitable component of the industry, making up approximately 28% of the gross value. Powered by genetics, producers have steadily increased the yields of grain crops over decades; however, gains are stagnating and it is clear that genetics alone cannot explain the differences in yields between our newest varieties. Enabled by a world-first Australian-innovated technology, this project will investigate if the chemical structure of DNA itself can explain yield differences. This is akin to testing if changing the grammar in a sentence can more efficiently convey its meaning. Project outcomes, including understanding the basis of improved yield, combined with our diagnostic tools, have great potential to help producers to develop higher yielding crops more rapidly, potentially increasing yield beyond current limits. Our technology is a breakthrough in cost-effective screening of plants, and through our connections with Australian crop improvement programs we will explore the potential for industry adoption. The approaches developed in this project could have broad applicability to challenges faced by Australian farmers including crop quality, nutrition, disease tolerance and climate resilience, which could increase the future profitability and sustainability of food production.",

This project aims to assess the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence in digital attacks on freedom of association and attempts to resist them in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. The project expects to generate new knowledge about the risks to human rights posed by AI using an innovative methodology built on qualitative approaches and cutting-edge digital techniques. Expected outcomes include a typology of digital attacks on freedom of association and responses to them and a prototype large language model capable of generating counter narratives. This should provide significant benefits to Australia, supporting its commitment to promoting Responsible AI Technologies and furthering its geo-strategic interests in Southeast Asia.",

The future success of these enterprises depends on a new generation of workers with advanced literacy skills to operate digital platforms that manage complex systems and the vision to coordinate the demands of product design, quality assurance, servicing and marketing. This project addresses this by targeting the major literacy demands of Industrial Technology – a Senior High School subject involving construction using timber, metals, graphics etc. Industrial Technology enrols 10% of students in NSW, who have the second lowest mean socio-economic status of all non-VET subjects, and who have consistently struggled with literacy throughout their schooling. These students are precisely those who will by and large move into the advanced manufacturing of the near future, and so we require new methods of literacy teaching to rectify the significant inequities they currently face. To address this, this project will develop new understandings of the literacy demands of Industrial Technology and new pedagogies for teaching literacy in conjunction with practical construction. These practices will be jointly designed with teachers to ensure teaching practices developed are relevant and targeted, and can be distributed amongst the Industrial Technology teaching community in ways that support this vital subject area and its students.",

    "summary": "In-situ investigation of dissolved oxygen fluxes in weir pools and rivers. This project aims to understand the turbulent mixing processes by which dissolved oxygen is transported from the surface of rivers and lakes into the water column by using unprecedented high-fidelity in-situ measurements. Australian inland rivers often go through prolonged periods of low flow and strong thermal stratification under which turbulent mixing is dramatically reduced resulting in low dissolved oxygen levels. These conditions can lead to large-scale fish kill events in fragile and endangered ecosystems. This study will develop gas transfer relationships that can be used in river hydraulic models by catchment managers to predict and manage the occurrence of high-risk conditions and enable proactive river management.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Large-scale fish kill events in Australia’s inland rivers can occur when dissolved oxygen levels fall below critical limits. These events are a significant threat to the ecology of river systems, the endangered animal species that live within them, and the health and livelihoods of the communities that live alongside the rivers. When oxygen levels within the water column decrease, toxic heavy metals can be released from sediments, bacteria grow from decaying fish, both requiring expensive treatment before the water can be used for drinking or agriculture. Understanding the occurrence of these events and being able to predict and prevent them is an urgent priority.  This project will discover the complex relationships which quantify the rate at which oxygen from the air enters and mixes into Australia’s unique river systems.  It will develop predictive models that can be used by river managers to determine the amount of oxygen supply from the ambient air into the river water under different flow and weather conditions. These models, which will be communicated to stakeholders who manage our river systems, can be used to estimate overall oxygen levels within the rivers and then to determine the minimum flow releases to prevent fish kills and plan the deployment or optimal usage of aeration systems or other interventions, ultimately safeguarding these valuable social, cultural, environmental and economic assets.",

Electric vehicles (EVs) represent a green revolution in transportation electrification to address these emission issues. However, challenges such as low driving range, operational safety and reliability, and passenger thermal comfort make EVs less appealing to users. This project aims to optimize EV operational performance by developing an energy management platform that effectively coordinates energy distribution, utilization, and recovery using Artificial Intelligence technology. The proposed energy platform will incorporate a novel CO2 heat pump air conditioning system to provide efficient heating and cooling for the EV cabin, and innovative battery cooling techniques to ensure battery safety and longevity. These advancements will enhance energy efficiency, extend driving range, and improve the reliability of EVs. Successful implementation of this project will enable manufacturers to design more efficient EVs capable of adapting to diverse driving conditions. This will significantly lower users' operational and maintenance costs, and enhance user thermal comfort, thereby fostering widespread market acceptance of EVs and delivering additional commercialization opportunities in Australia. The research outcomes will support Australia's transition from fuel-based to renewable energy-based vehicles, aligning well with the national long-term emission reduction plan aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.",

This project will examine how sensory areas of the human brain alter during sensory learning and how such changes in brain structure and function lead to improvements in sensory perception performance. We use cutting-edge methods that we have developed for ultra-high resolution functional brain imaging (7 Tesla MRI) and computational modelling to study markers of brain plasticity at a level never previously possible in the living human brain. The project therefore investigates the fundamental basis of human brain plasticity for sensory learning. This will provide critical new understanding of the micro-level function in sensory areas of the human brain that underpin sensory learning and perception.",

The brain’s ability to adapt and learn through sensory experience is essential for normal human development throughout life, for learning and acquisition of new skills, and for recovery of abilities following injury. As such, this research provides a crucial knowledge-base for applications in sensory learning and training programs, human-machine robotics developments, and interventions for rehabilitation following stroke or amputation. Our research will also develop MRI technology and computational methods that allow examination of the living human brain with unprecedented detail. We use ultra-high field MRI, using one of only two such MRI scanners in Australia (a major resource under the National Imaging Facility). Through our research program, we provide an advanced training ground for Australian scientists and MRI-technologists in human brain imaging, as well as translation into new medical imaging capabilities and clinical applications. Our research outcomes and computational tools will be promoted and shared through open-source repositories and open-access reports/publications, allowing broad and immediate translation and adoption. MRI advances will also be translated commercially through our existing MRI industry partners.",

As the predominant venue for ritual and theatrical performances in premodern and contemporary rural China, the temple theatre provides an insight into the dual function of temples as a sacred space for worship and a secular space for entertainment. The project expects to develop a new model for analysing the evolution of Chinese temple theatre architecture and the complex interaction between the sacred and the secular. The project should provide significant benefits, such as furthering the understanding of the liminal/liminoid link between temple and theatre and adding a new dimension to the spatial turn in theatre and performance studies.",

Enhanced cultural exchange and academic cooperation underpin Australia’s capacity to engage with China, its largest trading partner and primary source of international students, tourists and immigrants, thereby benefitting the Australian economy. The project will also contribute to future Australian research and policymaking on ethnic integration and social inclusion by offering fresh insights into the pivotal role of temples in the social and spiritual lives of community members from many religions. A further contribution of the project comes from our multidimensional approach that integrates the disciplines of anthropology, ethnography, archaeology, architecture, history, religion, theatre and performance studies, thereby bolstering Australia’s reputation as a global leader in Chinese temple, theatre and architecture scholarship. To ensure widespread comprehension and uptake of our research outcomes, proactive engagement with cultural and professional associations, organisation of public events and utilisation of media outlets and digital platforms for extensive dissemination and community engagement will be undertaken in Australia, China and beyond.",

This project focuses on aquatic parasite-host interactions, aiming to unveil novel molecular components governing finding processes. Utilising advanced comparative bioinformatics, proteomics, and animal behaviour analysis, interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers in molecular biology, chemistry, behaviour and parasitology is crucial. Anticipated outcomes will inform eco-friendly approaches to deter parasite-host interactions, including liver fluke parasites causing severe damage to Australian herbivorous livestock. This aligns with sustainability goals, offering practical solutions to pressing agricultural challenges in a concise and comprehensive manner.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The helminth parasite Fasciola hepatica is the primary causal agent of liver fluke disease, a disease that is estimated to infect over 600 million animals worldwide. In Australia, major economic losses exist upon livestock infection, yet current control measures, such as anthelmintic drugs, face significant challenges including emerging drug resistance and environmental disruption. A better understanding of the mechanism that enables the parasite to find its host would offer a unique avenue for life-cycle disruption. This project aims to address this gap by decoding waterborne semiochemicals (e.g., pheromones) that drive the parasites' dynamics. This new knowledge will inform the development of natural ‘bait’ traps that negate infection, potentially saving millions of livestock from disease, thus reducing the economic burden of Australia’s agricultural sector. As natural compounds, this would offer an eco-friendly parasite control that aligns with national environmental conservation goals, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and mitigating the ecological impact of conventional chemical treatments. Potential commercial opportunities for Australian biotechnology companies may arise from developing innovative parasite control technologies. To maximise the impact, engagement with industry stakeholders, policymakers, and agricultural organisations will be pursued through workshops, media outreach, and partnerships (e.g., Food and Agribusiness Growth Centre and QLD DAF).",

The incredible power of mRNA technology has been significantly demonstrated in generating innovative protection against pandemic viruses such as COVID-19. However, to fully realise the potential of mRNA we need to understand what ensures high level protein expression and how this can be modulated under different conditions. This project aims to identify and exploit the molecular mechanisms of viral elements directing protein translation. The significance is that the research will provide the development of specific reagents that promote high level protein production from mRNA. The expected outcomes include important knowledge gains in basic virology to identify viral elements that can meaningfully benefit the development of mRNA technology.",

They utilise structured RNA elements and viral proteins to recruit host factors that lead to substantially increased production of viral rather than the host proteins.This project will explore the mechanisms underpinning how some viruses control host protein translation. The newly acquired knowledge will advance our understanding of virus infection nationally and internationally, enhancing Australia’s reputation in these fields. The research outcomes will extend beyond academia as the new knowledge gained within this project will supercharge the emerging field of RNA biotechnology with innovative approaches for high-yield protein production from any mRNA molecule. This project will benefit Australians as it has the potential to substantially boost the performance of cutting-edge mRNA technologies. Commercial benefit will ensue by generating intellectual property and aid in establishing sovereign capacity in the development and manufacture of mRNA preventatives and therapeutics. The overall research outcomes will be communicated via scientific forums, publications in leading journals, open access and through engagement and collaboration with the commercial sector and industry. We envision that all of this combined will provide a research direction to increase the training and workforce in virology and mRNA biology in Australia. ",

To date, the multi-faceted interplay of mechanisms driving human aging remains poorly understood. Animal models are currently considered as gold standards for aging studies, but lack translatability to humans. Thus, this project focuses on engineering physiologically relevant in vitro aging models - aging in a dish. Novel reproducible models that will recapitulate the dynamic microenvironmental changes in physical properties during the aging process will be created and potentially replace the use of animal models. Future benefits of the project outcomes include catalysing the development of next generation dynamic biomaterials that are not limited to aging, but also other applications including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, tissue models, disease modelling and drug discovery. As the demand for biomaterials usage has increased globally, with a market size poised to reach $249 billion by 2028, this is a key area of investment for Australian research and materials industry. This project is expected to lead to future commercial benefits in national priority areas of advanced manufacturing of high-value, high-performance materials, by technology licensing and transfer to existing and new industry partners.",

    "summary": "Tailoring high-purity carbon from methane abatement via Joule-heating. This project aims to demonstrate efficient carbon material structural controls via a new direct Joule heating approach to produce multiple high-purity and high-value carbon products. This project expects to address a key challenge in splitting methane (the second most abundant greenhouse gas) into hydrogen and solid carbon materials without emitting carbon dioxide. Expected outcomes include new knowledge on carbon material formation, reaction kinetics, heat and mass transfer, and environmental and market impacts under new conditions. These will incentivise the industrial adoption of methane pyrolysis for methane abatement, carbon material, and hydrogen production, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building a more sustainable society.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Methane is a primary component of natural gas. Its capability to trap atmospheric heat is 28 times that of carbon dioxide. Methane also produces 62% of hydrogen currently used globally, which releases 600 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Methane is released into the atmosphere from many different sources: oil and natural gas systems, farms, wastewater treatment plants, landfills, and coal mines. It is the second most abundant human-influenced greenhouse gas. Existing methane removal methods depend on converting methane to carbon dioxide, producing more greenhouse gas emissions. This project will address this challenge with a novel technique: splitting methane into hydrogen and solid carbon materials without directly emitting carbon dioxide, powered by renewable electricity. The project will demonstrate that the resulting solid carbon materials can be used as conductive components to make fast-charging batteries and black pigments in inks/plants. The project will generate new scientific knowledge on controlling nanoscale structures of carbon materials. The research outcomes will enable the new methane removal method to increase its progression to become technology-ready. It will pave the way for the Australian industry's subsequent technical development and commercial adoption. Reducing methane emissions and producing \"clean\" hydrogen and solid carbon products with reduced carbon dioxide emissions will bring environmental benefits and build a more sustainable society.",

Epoxides, including propylene oxide, ethylene oxide etc, serve as crucial chemical building blocks with the epoxide market projected to surge to USD 86 billion by 2029, optimizing their production becomes imperative. High selectivity for epoxide products poses a significant challenge, due to the instability of metal-based catalytic materials.\nThis project endeavors to overcome this obstacle by harnessing the power of light to either inhibit or reverse the surface oxidation of metal catalysts. By doing so, we aim to drastically enhance the selectivity of epoxide products.

It will reveal how walking modulates perception at the step rate, the influence of intention (active vs passive action) and establish the neural mechanisms underlying the perception/action link. It will advance our knowledge of how the brain integrates its twin functions of perceiving the world and acting upon it and will generate useful knowledge for information transfer and time-critical responses in active contexts.",

This project brings together previously disconnected techniques and analyses from psychology, physiology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality to enable breakthroughs in our fundamental knowledge of how walking impacts sensory function. Project outcomes could be harnessed to inform public safety measures and enhance the efficiency of digital displays, communication systems, and device feedback mechanisms, thereby optimizing and enriching user experiences.

This project will developing a novel framework to significantly improve our understanding of plant nocturnal leaf respiration and its contribution to atmospheric carbon concentrations. It is widely assumed that respiration consumes sugars to make the energy needed to power cells and grow. However, recent work has shown that plants use other substances to fuel respiration, saving sugars for export from leaves to growing tissue. Not using sugars significantly alters carbon dioxide released during respiration, with important consequences for climate models that predict plant-atmosphere carbon exchange.

    "summary": "Evaluating compensation for harm to Indigenous culture in Queensland. In the wake of the High Court's (HCA's) decision about compensation for 'cultural loss' in Northern Territory v Griffiths [2019] HCA 7, research is urgently needed on the different forms of harm to Indigenous culture suffered as a result of colonisation. This project aims to undertake the first ethnographic investigation of harm outside the context of litigated compensation claims. By investigating the complexities of Indigenous experiences of colonisation, including frontier violence, incarceration on missions and reserves, and contemporary experiences of heritage destruction and interrupted knowledge transmission, this project will establish the knowledge base to resolve the coming wave of compensation claims by First Nations peoples.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Compensation for 'cultural loss' is a major focus of negotiations between governments and First Nations groups across Australia. With over 300 determined native title holding groups eligible to claim compensation, the Commonwealth, states, territories and other respondent parties (e.g., mining companies) face hundreds of future compensations claims worth billions of dollars. Treaty discussions across multiple jurisdictions have also raised the possibility of reparations for colonisation, including for harm suffered prior to the date (1975) after which acts resulting in cultural loss may be subject to compensation under the Native Title Act (1993). Yet there is a lack of independent academic research about Indigenous cultural loss, especially in anthropology, which has avoided the topic for a generation. By investigating the complexities of cultural loss in the Gulf Country of northwest Queensland, focusing on how Indigenous people feel about loss and how the experience of loss changes over time in who it affects and the kinds of feelings associated with it, this project aims to refine research methodologies relating to compensation in both the Gulf Country and the wider nation. As well as benefiting Indigenous peoples by enabling the negotiation of full, just, and fair settlements with claimant groups, this project aims to improve the practice of applied anthropology in this area, saving time and money, and avoiding the trauma associated with unsuccessful litigation.

This project expects to create new knowledge in the form of techniques and devices that actively remove noise from microwave quantum technologies at elevated temperatures, pushing the precision of measurements to the quantum limit.

This sociological project aims to investigate the societal drivers of the meanings and practices that shape public responses to the interdependencies and interrelationships between humans, microbes, immunity and the ecosystems and microbiomes of which they are a part. Involving the participation of Australians across diverse social groups, ages and locations, the project expects to identify public understandings of these topics. This research also plans to analyse publicly available information and investigate how people find and assess this information and put it into practice. To do so, qualitative and creative research methods will be combined with cutting-edge sociocultural theory. The project aims to use these insights to develop ideas about how best to promote knowledge and combat misinformation for a better informed public. Expected outcomes include the generation of new insights about community and other stakeholder understandings concerning the complex interconnections between people, society, immunity systems, microbiomes and microorganisms. It is expected that these insights will have social, cultural and economic benefits by contributing to better policy and communication strategies to enhance awareness of the importance of microorganisms to human and planetary wellbeing.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project is about developing a new method of determining how atoms are arranged and move in crystals smaller than a micrometre in size (nanocrystals), allowing us to visualise the 3D shapes of proteins. Knowledge of how atoms are arranged is critical for understanding the properties of materials and  how drugs work at the molecular level, driving technological and health innovation. Many dynamical processes are unmeasurable without using crystals smaller than a micrometre. By developing synchrotron nanocrystallography, this project will provide a new capability to record molecular movies of large molecules (like proteins) at the Australian Synchrotron and international synchrotrons. This will make nanocrystallography available to the Australian research community. The tangible benefits to Australian society are new materials or drugs that the Australian research community could discover in the future using our new technique. To maximise translation of this research outside academia, we will work with industry users of crystallography at the Australian Synchrotron and provide them access to equipment, analysis software and training to perform nanocrystallography. The longer-term goal is to enable industry to use nanocrystallography, as they currently do crystallography, for commercial research and development.",

    "summary": "Discovering new ways to generate targeted mutations. Life evolves by acquiring DNA from other organisms or mutating existing DNA sequences. Most mutations are neutral or deleterious. However, some organisms have developed site-directed mutagenesis that allows them to evolve small sections of their genomes. Phages, viruses that infect bacteria, are particularly adept at targeted mutagenesis as it allows them to infect many different bacteria. We have identified phages that reproducibly mutate their genomes but have yet to discover how they alter their sequences. We will combine genetic and genomic experiments with bioinformatics to identify new mechanisms phages use to create targeted mutations. These enzymes can be used for biotechnology and genome engineering. ",

Understanding how viruses change is essential to both exploiting and combatting them. While phages can mutate their DNA in specific ways, we only currently understand a few of these methods. In our lab, we have developed new tools to identify these targeted mutations, and this project will uncover the new mechanisms that phages use to create them. We will conduct experiments to identify these new mechanisms while developing innovative computer tools to compare thousands of phage genomes to uncover hidden mutation patterns. New insights into phage biology will lead to breakthrough biotechnological applications, benefiting Australian agriculture, biomedicine, and environmental management. Understanding phages will also help develop antibiotic alternatives, like phage therapy, to benefit Australians in the future by improving health and combating antibiotic resistance. We will promote our outcomes by collaborating with large and small biotech companies, creating engaging public content, and publishing our groundbreaking research in top-tier scientific journals. In addition, all of our software will be made open source and publicly available to drive future impacts. ",

There is an urgent worldwide need to find an effective method to conserve heritage, such as Indigenous sandstone rock art sites which are at risk of permanent loss. This project aims to develop an innovative approach to rock art conservation by integrating Indigenous knowledge into decision-making processes, while pioneering the use of new femtosecond (fs) lasers for cleaning stone without causing surface damage, and robotic control of the fs laser system. Expected outcomes include a novel governance framework, and a sustainable method for preserving culture.

Working under the cultural guidance of Traditional Owners this project will explore new, eco-friendly laser techniques for cleaning the art. Complex rock surfaces mean that the laser will need a “Human-in-the-loop” robotic control system to integrate the strengths of humans (cultural knowledge, perception, decision-making) with the strengths of robots (accuracy, speed, power, and consistency) so  we will explore how to embed cultural decision-making processes into AI control of the laser.\nDirt, biological growth and weathering crusts affect outdoor surfaces everywhere, so this work will advance precision cleaning options across Australia and beyond. Laser cleaning offers environmental benefits (no chemicals, electrical power), commercial opportunities (conservation cleaning) and economic benefits (tourism income from upgraded heritage sites). Embedding cultural knowledge into laser control systems ensures culturally appropriate decision-making and promotes jobs for community participation in conservation. To connect with a range of potential markets for this research (eg rock art and building conservation; precision surface cleaning; graffiti removal; surface decontamination) we will publish short articles in relevant industry newsletters/magazines. We will also publish detailed articles in open access academic journals.",

A key element of Australia's strategy to achieve this focusses on prioritising species or places where the greatest conservation opportunity exists. Islands play a crucial role in conserving species that are threatened or extinct on the mainland. This is because many of the threats that species face on the mainland are absent on islands. However, species on islands can be very susceptible to extinction if threats like invasive species reach them, and islands are particularly vulnerable to impacts associated with climate change. This project will be a partnership between First Nations ranger groups and scientists. It will comprehensively assess the status and trends in the biodiversity of northern Australia’s islands, which are predominantly First Nations-owned. The project will help us to conserve our unique wildlife by understanding the conservation opportunities and risks on islands and identifying the environmental management strategies that have had the best outcomes. The project will also build networks across island managers, and increase skill levels in environmental monitoring through formal training programs. The project will involve First Nations organisations and communities in research design and implementation, and will collaboratively develop methods and information resources to support environmental monitoring and management by community and government organisations.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "As a driving force of artificial intelligence, multi-layered artificial neural networks, called deep neural networks, have been widely used in many fields of society. Deep neural networks enable computer systems to learn from data in a manner similar to the functioning of the human brain. Consequently, they can build the capability of performing complex operations on massive amounts of data and making decisions. The training of such powerful network models is challenging and costly. Such models are also vulnerable to copyright infringements, causing major losses for model owners. This project examines the vulnerabilities of deep neural network models to various attacks and develops innovative watermarking mechanisms and algorithms for the copyright protection of deep neural network models, which will deter illegal and nefarious players from exploiting those vulnerabilities. Benefits will include curbing cybercrime and other illegal activities caused by copyright infringements, greater commercial opportunities for Australian companies, expansion of deep learning for real-world applications such as autonomous driving, and economic gain through greater protection of intellectual investment. The research outcomes and their use in practice will be promoted through workshops, industry meetings, and industry networks such as the Australian Industry Group and Australian Information Industry Association.\n\n",

In industrial contexts, quality inspectors use haptic assessments to detect signs of aging in rubber products. Similarly, in medical settings, surgeons rely on analysing surface stiffness distributions to identify cancerous margins during tumour dissection. \n\nThis project aims to explore optimal strategies for integrating computer vision, machine learning, and robotics to address current research gaps in 3D stiffness mapping of deformable surfaces within confined spaces. Our approaches will enhance the accuracy and efficiency of existing technologies, facilitating the remote estimation of mechanical properties of delicate objects with limited accessibility. \n\nBy addressing a critical need in industrial and medical robotics, this project has the potential to deliver tangible economic benefits to these sectors, which are projected to reach market values of USD 165.35 billion and USD 31.5 billion by 2028, respectively.\n\nMoreover, the research carries significant potential benefits for the Australian healthcare system. With the future potential to improve the precision of medical diagnoses and reduce the risk of relapse through more accurate identification of cancer margins, this study can make a substantial contribution to public health. \n\nMedia engagements and public events will ensure widespread dissemination, enhance public understanding, and generate commercial interest.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project serves an increasing demand for a better understanding of large mathematical structures called hypergraphs. Hypergraphs are abstract models of multi-way relationships within any set, and are used in a wide variety of applications from ecology to epidemiology. Designs are hypergraphs that give a way to group objects into blocks that satisfy strict balance and regularity conditions. This is key in statistical studies, controlling the effects of the variables being tested and reducing the impact of other random factors. Designs are also widely used in fields as diverse as software testing, tournament scheduling and communications technology. Many questions about large hypergraphs remain unanswered, including their typical properties. Our results will lead to significant benefits including:\n(i) the discovery of new hypergraphs and designs that may be used in the above applications,\n(ii) a greater understanding of the structure of complex systems such as networks,\n(iii) faster algorithms for constructing hypergraphs with desired properties, and for processing them once they have been built,\n(iv) enhanced links between researchers in three leading Australian universities, and their international collaborators,\n(v) training for a number of young researchers in an area which underpins many modern information and communication technologies.\nResults will be communicated in journals and conferences, and via outreach activities to the broader community.",

Using unique custom-made nuclear magnetic resonance sensors, this research quantifies the dynamics of source-sink (leaf to seed) transfer of material in plants and its variation during resource limited and stressful environmental conditions. Further, this research identifies the influence of leaf hydration (water content) and environmental conditions on leaf stomatal aperture, a process that governs leaf carbon and water relations. This dual focus, addresses two significant gaps in our understanding of plant function and will lead to 1) new metrics for crop selection to improve food security and 2) more informed intervention to mitigate stressful environmental conditions.

The emergence of herbicide-resistant weeds is placing an ever-increasing strain on agricultural outputs, outpacing the development of new herbicide options. Concerningly, Australia has the second largest number of resistant weeds globally. Rather than developing new herbicides, this project aims to investigate the other side of the problem: how does herbicide resistance emerge and spread? Leveraging lessons from combatting drug resistance, our work proposes to explore a new mechanism of resistance transfer—extracellular vesicles. Our findings have the potential to revolutionise strategies to preserve and restore the efficacy of current and future herbicides, with long-term social, economic, and environmental benefits. Bolstering weed management will boost food production, reduce input costs for farmers, and minimise damage to ecosystems, via a project that pioneers new directions and leadership for globally relevant agricultural research. Results will be communicated through industry-oriented meetings, publications, and press releases to keep relevant industry groups and the public informed; at the same time, potential commercial opportunities to develop effective new herbicide adjuvants and monitoring tools will be shared with long-term industry partners to fast-track delivery of these benefits to Australian farmers, communities, and land.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "To expedite Australia’s transition to a competitive, carbon-neutral economy, developing advanced energy technologies with minimal carbon emissions is crucial. Hydrogen energy is particularly important for Australia’s clean energy future. While water electrolysis can produce hydrogen using renewable electricity from sources like solar and wind, it faces challenges due to the low efficiency, poor stability, and high costs of key materials. This project aims to overcome these challenges by developing advanced water electrolysis technologies using novel electrolyser devices made of a type of inorganic materials called perovskite oxides, which act as both electrode and electrolyte. These materials can be produced using non-noble metals abundant in Australia, benefiting the manufacturing and chemical industries. The project will fill critical research gaps by enhancing our understanding of how these perovskite materials perform under practical water electrolysis conditions, which is essential for advancing the technology and maximising the use of renewable energy in Australia. The success of this project is expected to position Australia as a key player in the global hydrogen market, opening new export opportunities. To maximise the impact, we will share our findings with industry stakeholders, policymakers, and the public through workshops, seminars, and partnerships, ensuring broad understanding and adoption of the technology.",

We will bridge a crucial research gap by integrating ethics with actuarial analyses, proposing a new framework to evaluate the justice of climate disaster insurance responses, especially for vulnerable communities. Our research offers significant benefits to Australians across multiple dimensions. Economically, it addresses the unsustainable costs of climate disasters, guiding policy for fair and effective insurance mechanisms. Socially, it ensures equitable access to protection, enhancing community resilience and well-being. Environmentally, by incentivizing risk reduction, it promotes sustainable development practices. Commercially, it fosters innovation in insurance models and risk management strategies.To maximize the impact of our research beyond academia, we will employ a multifaceted communication strategy. This includes scholarly publications, conferences, stakeholder workshops, and a dedicated website. By engaging policymakers, industry stakeholders, and the public, we aim to facilitate understanding, translation, and adoption of our research findings, ensuring tangible benefits for all Australians.",

Most animals build constructions, such as nests, that are critical to their survival or reproduction. These structures have been refined over millions of years of evolution to protect species from climatic variables, but our climate is changing rapidly. Our project will combine detailed data from Australian species and analyses over thousands of species worldwide to generate a framework to evaluate the capacity of animal builders to adjust their designs to cope with the increasing temperatures forecast. We will focus on birds because their embryos are extremely vulnerable to temperature increases and high nest temperatures are already threatening some populations. Our research will benefit Australian fauna and ecosystems by assessing animal capacities to adapt to increasing temperatures. We will generate a modelling tool that will allow researchers to evaluate the risks of embryo death for different species and locations in Australia. Our global analysis will also enable us to identify vulnerable species where protection from building behaviours is constrained. Partnerships with government agencies will allow the dissemination of this model and information to agencies involved in conservation research and monitoring. Finally, this project will solidify Australia’s leadership in ecology and evolution.",

We lack control in synthesising polymer’s lengths, composition and block sequences. This project will develop a new robotic platform to synthesis precise polymers autonomously using machine learning. This new, more efficient pathway can address existing limitations in control and revolutionise the field of materials science. The efficient production of effective advanced materials has many economic, environmental and social benefits for Australia.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Gender inequalities disadvantage girls and women globally, leading to reduced opportunities, lost human capital, and lost potential. A key driver of violence against women, gender inequalities also cost lives. Research suggests that living in a more gender-equal society benefits everyone.  For these reasons, addressing gender inequality is a key priority for Australia. However, current measures do not capture the complexity of how gender inequalities operate, interact and impact on society, meaning that efforts to tackle gender inequality may be ineffective. This project directly addresses this issue. Applying innovative analytical approaches to the newly developed Australian Gender Equality Index (an area-level measure comprising 12 indicators of gender equality), this project will map, clarify, explore and monitor how gender inequality operates and impacts on lives, and identify optimal levers to reduce these inequalities, whilst also exploring how experiences of gender inequality differ for different groups of people. This project will produce knowledge about how gender inequality is patterned in Australia and the implications this has for social, economic and health outcomes. This information is essential for governments to maximise the benefits of gender equality initiatives and ensure future policy is effective. Translation and adoption of project results will be facilitated and expedited by a diverse advisory committee and via established links with external partners. ",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Across Australia, the percentage of First Nations students from remote communities who remain at school until Year 12 is critically low. In the Northern Territory and Western Australia the situation is at its worst. Fewer than 3% of students complete high school, resulting in limited access to employment and further study. Successive attempts at intervention have resulted in ill-equipped one size fits all approaches, missed ‘Closing the Gap’ targets, and remote Aboriginal school completion and employment rates that continue to fall. This project aims to determine what remote schools and systems can do to retain and support First Nations students to complete school successfully. To do this, our experienced First Nations education research team will work closely with stakeholders connected to schools in remote Northern Territory and Western Australian communities to achieve social, economic, cultural and educational benefits for Elders, community members, educators and students. We will work to explore and address issues from the ‘grassroots level’ to cater for the unique and diverse needs that exist within these communities. By working closely with schools to help them address their specific needs, the project will identify innovative solutions to support school completion and transition to university, training and employment. In so doing it will develop an implementable model, supported by resources, that can be used across the nation to tackle this ongoing social crisis.",

This project investigates what the history and memory of rail (1870s-1960s) can tell us about some of Australia’s most neglected social histories. Focusing on transcultural and gendered histories of railway, it aims to ‘derail’ a more familiar progressivist or technological story of nation-building to highlight histories of non-European and gendered labour and community-building. These aspects of railway networks’ social histories remain little understood within either a national or an international comparative frame.

Less understood are the social histories of the ordinary men and women who engaged with rail as a site of work, domestic life and cultural exchange. This project aims to uncover the diverse social histories and cultural legacies relating to the development of Australian transcontinental rail over a century, and to place them within an international frame. It investigates the labour of non-European and women workers who helped construct and maintain Australia’s largest inland railways; the evolution of cross-cultural communities and systems of colonial governance that emerged along railway lines; and the domestic and gendered aspects of railway work and life. This project will bring to light neglected transcultural and gendered histories of rail that have been obscured by a more nostalgic history of technological progress, and it will locate those histories within a larger global history of ‘railway imperialism’. Supported by the National Railway Museum and two state libraries, the project will benefit Australia by generating a more inclusive social history of Australian rail. Among its public-facing outcomes are a GIS-enabled, interactive digital map that will help make Australia’s diverse transcultural and gendered railway heritage accessible to new public audiences.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The ability to form memories is critical for survival. Memory is regulated by many genes working together in a network, with specific parts of the brain playing distinct roles. While current research focuses on individual genes and broad brain sections, we are missing crucial details on the network of molecular processes that occur during memory formation and the distinct contributions of key brain cells. This project will bridge these gaps – doing so by studying the compact, well-characterised brain of the ‘worm’ C. elegans. We will identify drivers of positive and negative memories, study wider protein networks in critical neurons of the worm brain, and explore how different senses influence memory formation, all while advancing novel experimental techniques for cell-specific protein network labelling that are broadly applicable for detailed neuroscience studies. Through this, we will identify the essential molecular and cellular requirements of robust memory. Our work will drive a fundamental understanding of the biology of stable memories; discoveries which, in the long term, may help support quality of life for ageing Australians vulnerable to memory loss. Keeping memories intact for longer is not only better for health, but also enables older Australians to remain active in society and the economy. To keep the public apprised of our findings, our team will extend our strong track record and commitment to community engagement, science outreach, and media activities.",

Electrosynthesis utilises renewable electricity to drive chemical reactions, enabling sustainable and energy-efficient processes. Our research will bridge crucial knowledge gaps in electrosynthesising propylene, provide significant insights into the main challenge of achieving C-C-C coupling, and potentially revolutionise our understanding of key molecular pathways, catalyst materials, and reaction-environment designs needed for success. The economic and commercial benefits for Australia include fostering new sectors in green technology, creating jobs, reducing dependency on chemical imports, and exploiting Australia’s rich renewable energy resources. Environmentally, the project supports Australia's commitments to reducing emissions and protecting ecosystems.

This project aims to develop a cementless carbon-negative concrete technology that addresses current decarbonisation needs of the cement industry that is responsible for about 8% of the world’s CO2. The project expects to generate new knowledge in this area to enable the establishment of a concrete technology that will act as a secure and significant carbon sink while remaining structurally sound and durable. Expected project outcomes consist in the establishment of the new concrete technology with negative carbon-embodied characteristics for mass production and for a wide range of applications in buildings and the built environment. This will lead to significant benefits for the Australian building and construction industry.\n",

Concrete is responsible for a significant carbon footprint of the construction sector because cement (one of its key components) produces about 8% of the world’s CO2.\nIt is critical for Australia to find ways of competing in the construction industry using research-based methods, and the project’s technological cutting-edge developments are expected to have a positive impact on the capacity of the Australian construction industry through the development of a new cementless carbon-negative technology for reducing the carbon footprint of buildings and for supporting the implementation of effective strategies to achieve net-zero and negative-carbon constructions while relying on available concrete production equipment and processes to enable an efficient industrial translation of the technology in view of the requirements to meet the 2030 and 2050 net-zero construction targets.\nIn the increasingly competitive international market, Australian companies and professionals will benefit from having access to a new cementless carbon-negative concrete technology to deliver cutting edge solutions that produce carbon-negative and healthier buildings and urban solutions.\n",

Millions of mobile DNA sequences compose approximately half of the mammalian genome, yet their influence on gene expression remains largely unexplored. The project proposed here will 1) develop a novel system to predict how strongly a given mobile DNA sequence will promote its own expression and that of adjacent genes, 2) test those predictions using long-read functional genomics applied to various cell types generated in vitro and 3) discover new regulatory elements underpinning development in vivo. The expected outcomes are an unprecedented understanding of gene regulation, which will benefit biotechnology applications of genetic engineering, as well as enhanced international collaboration.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Mobile DNA sequences can copy themselves from one genomic location to another and are particularly abundant in animals and plants. For more than 50 years it has been hypothesised that most genes are regulated in eukaryotes by mobile DNA sequences. Until recently we have lacked the tools to systematically test this overarching theory in biology. Exploiting recent technological advances, we will here apply CRISPR gene editing, long-read DNA sequencing and other cutting-edge tools to human cells to finally decide the contribution made by mobile DNA sequences to gene control and development. This work has the potential to enhance the Australian biotechnology sector as, for instance, bioengineering cells for drug production or new yeast strains for commercial brewing requires a full picture of how genes are regulated. As well, because all livestock and crop species contain mobile DNA, and these elements can dramatically impact phenotype via gene regulation, the insights we gain from human cells could in the future be applied to boost agricultural production and overcome environmental challenges. The researchers leading this project will here continue their track record of communicating scientific outcomes to mainstream audiences nationally and internationally, for example via social media and by providing interviews to the popular press. Finally, by involving postgraduate students, the project will contribute to higher education and training in the life sciences in Australia.",

This project will develop a theoretically well founded and computationally feasible spatio-temporal modelling and signal processing framework to exploit the coming revolution in event-based sensors exemplified by the recent arrival of commercial event cameras.  Event sensors measure relative signal changes, generating asynchronous event streams with low latency and high dynamic range, offering hope that robots and other autonomous systems can perceive the world in real time as events occur rather than via freeze frames provided by classical cameras and digital sensors. Project outcomes will enable safer autonomous driving, visual communication systems for smart cities, and a range of applications in consumer electronics and virtual reality.",

This project will establish design principles and develop algorithms required by autonomous systems and robots to perceive the world in real time using arrays of spatio-temporal event sensors such as event cameras and tactile sensors, enabling them to act quickly, safely, and efficiently in complex dynamic environments that render existing systems sluggish and unsafe. It will enable new capability in products ranging from consumer devices, cameras and virtual-reality headsets, through robotic vacuum cleaners and autonomous vehicles, to large multimillion-dollar aerospace and defence systems. It will help unlock the full economic benefits of autonomous systems that are predicted to create $AU1 trillion in value for Australia's economy by 2030.   Improved situational awareness of autonomous systems leads to advances in collision avoidance systems that improve the safety of land, sea, and air vehicles in the home, in the city, and on the highway, with direct societal benefit in reducing accident and mishap rates.  Australia's large and growing community of robotics and automation start-ups and established firms will benefit both directly from the alumni that will be trained within the project, but also from the open-source code and industry outreach that the project will undertake.  \n\n",

This project will determine if this form of neurodiversity is related to the expression of Autistic traits in the general population, test if Aphantasics are resistant to intrusive thoughts, and identify neural correlates of Aphantasia.\n \nThis project will deliver important new basic knowledge, that will be important for theory and will create important long-term translation opportunities to advantage society.\n\nVisualisation is among the world's most popular psychological interventions to benefit mental health and performance, but it is unclear if Aphants can equally benefit from this. So, by validating protocols to detect Aphants, we may create knowledge that can be translated to guide treatment decisions and resource allocation. Moreover, while Aphantasia is not a clinical condition, an inability to have imagined visual experiences is a key dimension of the most popular metric of Autistic traits in the general population. So, by creating greater understanding of visual imagery, and its benign dysfunction, we may increase understanding of ‘fact thinking’ Autistics. Finally, this project will bring together some world leading experts, in Autism research and fMRI data analyses, and they will train promising Australian research students in these skills. ",

Social capital refers to the networks of human relationships and activities that foster the development of healthy and cohesive communities, helping society and government function effectively. However, growing evidence suggests that social capital in Australia is declining. Australian public libraries – in which the nation invests over $1.24 million annually – have 1706 service points and over 146 million annual visits. This positions them ideally to foster social cohesion and trust in community and thus help lead the way in enabling stronger social capital. Yet very little is currently known about how public libraries develop social capital. This project will address this by establishing an empirically derived maturity model that can inform the design and delivery of library services to more effectively contribute to building socially cohesive, information-rich, economically strong and culturally vibrant Australian communities. Engagement with library associations throughout the project and via the online symposium launching the framework will ensure the project is relevant to key stakeholders.",

    "summary": "Experiences and inequalities in Indonesia’s transition to hospital birth. This project aims to explain inequalities in maternal health by investigating the hospital birth experiences of diverse and disadvantaged Indonesian women. Nearly 80% of Indonesian births take place in a health facility but the maternal mortality ratio remains the highest in Southeast Asia. Working with Indonesian researchers, this project expects to produce in-depth knowledge of women’s birth experiences and interactions with maternity care systems. Expected outcomes include new knowledge of why some women avoid health facilities or have negative experiences, and how to improve birth experiences. This benefits Australian and Indonesian agendas to create equitable, inclusive maternal health care and advance equality in our region.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Globally and in Australia, rates of maternal mortality and birth trauma are worse for disadvantaged women and cultural minorities. This indicates that current approaches to maternity care are not doing enough to address diversity or improve equity. Indonesia’s maternal mortality ratio is the worst in Southeast Asia despite most births occurring in a health facility. This project aims to explain the social and cultural factors that hamper Indonesian women from receiving adequate maternity care and develop new knowledge of what respectful or harmful care means to diverse populations. This will benefit Australia by informing our international development aid programmes. Indonesia is a top recipient of Australian Overseas Development Assistance (about $300 million AUD annually); this research will benefit the ‘Partnership Toward Inclusion’ initiative and ‘Australia’s International Development Policy’ (2023) by identifying ways to improve the accessibility and quality of services for women and people with disabilities and sharing this with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and others. This research also benefits Australia by sharing knowledge on how to eliminate discrimination and abuse in maternity care, a problem that costs Australia $877 million per year through social, health, and economic impacts of birth trauma.

    "summary": "Looks aren’t everything - the coevolution of galaxy structure & environment. Galaxies have immense diversity in their visual appearance. Interestingly, their looks are strongly correlated with where they live - galaxies in over-dense environments appear very different to those in isolated regions. This suggests that a galaxy's local environment impacts its appearance.  Hidden in these looks is a wealth of information about how the galaxy formed and evolved - with different visual structures having different evolutionary paths. Extracting this information is problematic and requires high resolution (space-telescope) imaging, sophisticated software and robust environmental measurements. In this project we will use state-of-the-art data and software to determine how galaxy environments shape their visual appearance.",

This project will strongly maximise return on these investments. It will create unique science that will raise the international profile of Australian astronomy, and attract and train young scientists in modern astronomy surveys and analysis. This will lead to highly desirable and transferable skills, which will benefit the Australian economy.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Indigenous Australians have managed, harvested, and processed the seeds of native grasses for food for millennia—a testimony to the nutritional value of these grains. Native grasses grow throughout Australia, having evolved to thrive in challenging environments, including those too hot or dry for crops like wheat. An Indigenous-led native grains industry has the potential to produce cultural, environmental, and health benefits for Aboriginal communities and the broader Australian population. Co-designing scientific, culturally responsive research of direct benefit for Indigenous communities is paramount. Knowledge of the interactions among environmental factors (including soil type, temperature, and water availability) and grain quality (including grain size and nutrient composition) is needed for commercialisation of native grain production by Indigenous enterprises. In collaboration with Gomeroi/Gamilaraay communities in northern NSW, this project will determine environmental effects on grain quality of four species of native grasses used historically as sources of food: Button Grass, Curly Mitchell Grass, Native Millet, and Weeping Grass. We will generate knowledge critical for managing native grasslands for grain production and for the success of Indigenous-led native food initiatives. Our project’s findings will be shared through regular workshops with Gamilaraay co-designers and stakeholders and with the broader community via newsletters, webinars and articles.",

Through innovation in single-molecule science, electrochemistry, microscopy and surface science the project will revolutionise electronic components for integrated circuits and diagnostic devices. Technological challenges addressed by this project include the high-energy consumption of current all-silicon electronics and the lack of point-of-care sensors capable of detecting rare but physiologically relevant biological molecules. Outcomes include building the instruments and the surface chemistry tools necessary to accurately orient molecules with respect to semiconductor electric fields, and will lead to the first room-temperature silicon-based superconducting diode as well as miniature health monitors capable of detecting trace-level hormones.

In complex scenarios, such as customer-level marketing studies or macroeconomic forecasting, statistical models built from multiple component sub-models are emerging as a powerful choice. The components are called modules, and the resulting multi-module statistical model is scalable, more fully uses all available data sources, exploits any inter-disciplinary knowledge, and can greatly improve prediction accuracy. However, the methodology required to operationalize such models is under-developed, and this project fills this gap. A problem unique to multi-module models is called feedback, which is where one or more unreliable modules can corrupt the other modules. Combining innovations in machine learning and data science, this project will produce algorithms and methods to identify and prevent feedback. This fundamental research will extend the use of multi-module statistical models to many new situations and greatly improve predictive accuracy. We will use it to develop econometric models that provide greater consumer insights in marketing and more accurate probabilistic predictions in macroeconomics. By providing software in the public domain, along with extensive examples, we aim to further promote adoption of these new powerful methods by researchers and practitioners. Finally, the project will train researchers in an area of skill shortage in Australia.",

They are simple to make, easy to introduce, and designed to spread through widely dispersed populations. They can be customized to change any trait, and in the extreme, drive entire species to extinction. The simplicity and power of these tools presents both significant opportunities and risks for Australian agriculture, environment, and biotechnology industry. This project aims to address the almost complete absence of research in how gene drives will work in protists – complex, single cell organisms that are only distantly related to animals, plants, and bacteria. In Australia, protists are both beneficial – e.g. ensuring the growth and survival of coral reefs – and damaging – e.g. a major disease burden for the $33 billion livestock and poultry industries, and significant infective agent in native wildlife. By understanding how gene drives will work in protists, we will provide knowledge essential to safely regulating and developing this technology while addressing the risks of, and responses to, their accidental introduction or malicious use. The findings will be used for decision-making by agriculture and biotechnology industry bodies, policy makers, biosecurity, and public health organisations.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Our world is rapidly transforming into a highly networked society, with seamless access to communications, data, and content. These communications are universal and must be possible anytime and anywhere. Wireless communications have now become an indispensable commodity with end users expecting reliable and high-speed connectivity at all times. As businesses and society can no longer tolerate even minor interruptions to their services, existing infrastructure must be adapted to prevent any service outage. Our research will address this massive challenge. We will investigate and develop solutions to realise intelligent high-speed communication systems that in the event of service interruptions are able to self-configure and quickly restore connectivity without triggering any outages. Our project will use an emerging technique to process signals in real-time to make informed decisions that will reconfigure the network with minimal intervention using low computational power and energy. We will use white papers and presentations to empower practitioners, and engage with groups focusing on standards to help shape policy and guidelines. The outcomes of our project will provide future Australian communication networks with greater protection against and prevention of network failures, providing economic and social benefits to Australia. Wireless payment will be free of costly outages for businesses and our quality of life will be improved. ",

Current psychological models focus on thoughts and feelings about pain, but completely neglect the role of mental imagery, despite its frequent, distressing, and intrusive nature in people experiencing pain. Our research seeks to advance knowledge in pain research and theory by exploring the causal relationship between mental imagery and increased pain perception. Using rigorous experimental designs and innovative approaches like virtual reality, we will delineate the role of specific aspects of mental imagery, building a more comprehensive model of pain. Our collaboration with leading international experts in pain and imagery will inform further research in cognitive science, and applied research to prevent everyday pain experiences from becoming debilitating.\nChronic pain affects one in five people (over 3 million Australians) and currently lacks effective treatments due to an incomplete understanding of its mechanisms. Our studies provide a foundation for developing scalable, low-cost treatments that could improve quality of life for people with chronic pain, offering significant healthcare, economic, and societal benefits for Australia.\nAdditionally, we will promote our research outcomes beyond academia through public outreach, working with healthcare providers, and via media channels, ensuring maximum reach, translation, and adoption of findings.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "More than half of the 1.9 million tonnes of urea fertiliser currently applied to Australian soils is not used by plants but is lost to the environment through leaching, volatilization, and denitrification. This causes massive environmental issues, such as water pollution, soil degradation, greenhouse gas impacts through potent N2O emissions, and reduced biodiversity in soils and coastal waters, as well as health effects associated with nitrates in groundwater. This is a national and global issue and is of urgent concern for the Great Barrier Reef catchment, with high nutrient loads leading to crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks and accelerated coral bleaching. Current controlled release alternatives are coated in nondegradable plastics, leaving up to 40 kg/ha/yr of undesirable microplastic pollution after use. This project aims to produce novel, cost-effective, biodegradable, and bioderived coatings for urea that slow fertiliser release to match crop demand, increasing nitrogen use efficiency without leaving harmful residues. Industry appropriate processing approaches will be developed, ready for commercialisation. These environmentally friendly fertilisers could support Australian agricultural industries to achieve more sustainable management of soil and water, and help position Australia as a leader in circular economy innovation. With >100 million t/year of synthetic N fertiliser applied globally, this is also a massive market opportunity for Australian businesses.",

    "summary": "Controlling the lifetime of biodegradable polymers in natural environments. Plastic waste in the environment is a massive global problem. One key solution is to substitute nondegradable plastics with bioderived and truly biodegradable polymers. Tailoring the rate of biodegradation of these polymers is essential for optimizing their functional performance and environmental impact. Yet the fundamental mechanisms of polymer biodegradation are poorly understood, with little current control over bioplastic lifetimes. This project will create model materials with a variety of surface topologies and chemistries in order to better understand biodegradation mechanisms and develop strategies to manipulate biodegradation rates and predict plastic lifetimes, paving the way for more sustainable solutions to plastic pollution.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "More than 420 million tonnes of plastic are produced every year, and this is forecast to triple by 2060. Yet our waste management systems are not able to adequately handle these flows. As a result, plastic pollution is now a global crisis, with 19-23 million tonnes per annum of plastic waste already leaking into aquatic ecosystems, according to conservative UN estimates – 130,000 tonnes per annum in Australia alone. In light of this, the search is on for materials that can replace those that are likely to end up in the environment, with a focus on bioderived plastics that will biodegrade instead of remaining as macro- or micro/nanopollutant hazards for decades. However, the biodegradation lifetimes, rates and mechanisms of these emerging plastics are still poorly understood. If we want to control and manipulate these processes, we need to develop a deeper understanding of the drivers for biodegradation, using model materials that can help us understand the factors that accelerate or slow biodegradation rates. This project expects to lay the necessary scientific foundations for the development of environmentally friendly biodegradable plastic products to support Australia to achieve more sustainable management of plastic materials and to help position Australia as a leader in circular economy innovation. The adoption of this technology also enables Australian manufacturers to produce high-value materials with tailored biodegradability for this massive global market. ",

Bacteria represent a third pillar supporting the symbiosis between coral and their algal partner, but despite being critical for coral resilience, this tripartite partnership is poorly characterized. Applying advanced imaging and sequencing approaches, this work will determine how bacterial interactions in corals are sustained, their function in maintaining coral health and whether they help stabilize the faltering coral symbiosis under environmental stress. Detailing the cellular processes that underpin coral health is critical for implementation of strategies to increase coral resilience and protect the values of the Great Barrier Reef faced with rapidly warming oceans.

The sustainability of the GBR is under threat from ongoing environmental impacts, including repeat mass bleaching events. These impacts can spill into a loss of credibility for Australian environmental stewardship and identity. Microorganisms underpin the health of corals that build the GBR, thus new strategies are being developed to manipulate microbes to buffer against climate impacts. However, these approaches are confounded by limited understanding of how microbes contribute to coral health. Our work is critical to improve strategies that protect corals from a changing climate and maintain reefs for future generations, providing direct value to the Australian community and tangible benefits to management of the world heritage listed GBR. Research outcomes will be adopted in novel strategies (i.e., probiotics) and implemented in expanding coral aquaculture commercial opportunities focused on building healthy resilient reefs. The translative work in this area will support upskilling across academia and industry, critical to the on-going fight to preserve our marine resources. New knowledge will underpin a healthy GBR which is critical to the Australian national interest through its direct economic contribution of $6.4 billion and 64,000 jobs, attracting millions of tourists each year and sustaining important marine industries and ecosystem services.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "‘AGEs’ are a group of compounds that form when excess sugars in the bloodstream react with proteins and lipids. We know that people with increased AGEs face much higher complication rates from biomaterial implant surgeries (e.g. hip replacements, pinning of fractures), which reveals a key gap in knowledge about the interaction of AGEs and the biomaterials interface. At present, there is no understanding of the ‘mechanics’ of AGE deposition on biomaterial surfaces, the implications of this accumulation on the inflammatory environment, or how this ultimately affects the biomaterial being accepted or rejected by the body. Our project will address these gaps, generating advanced knowledge for the design of next-generation high added-value products, such as novel implants and tissue engineering constructs that have manageable and predictable inflammatory outcomes. This would, ultimately, enhance the wellbeing of Australians. Although focused on fundamental science, the project has potential to develop new IP that can be exploited by Australian companies and lead to new high added-value manufacturing sectors and skilled employment. Technologies that could emerge from this project are exactly the advanced industries of the future that Australia needs, and align seamlessly with Government manufacturing priorities. We have strong track records in outcomes dissemination and translating research findings to commercial products and will continue to work actively with industry.",

Recent Royal Commissions highlight how service gaps and experiences of involuntary psychiatric intervention can undermine a range of rights, including people’s right to the highest attainable standard of mental health. A major barrier to change is the absence of a human rights implementation assessment tool for mental health-related policy, practice, and law. This project will develop such a tool that offers a way to measure Australia’s compliance with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (‘CRPD’), creating a ‘CRPD indicator’. The research team will use co-design methods so that people affected by rights violations can co-develop the indicator as experts by experience. A CRPD indicator will help analyse the commitment of governments to enact international human rights law in the mental health context. The indicator will be designed for governments and a range of civil society organisations, including associations for mental health service users, practitioners, families, and carers. Engagement activities will be held with these stakeholders throughout the project to ensure the indicator can be readily integrated into law, policy, and practice. Social, economic, and cultural gains will result from mental health services that better meet people’s needs, improving health and safety for all Australians.",

Although current microscopes can measure and track biomolecules at the nanometre scale, they cannot measure and track different biomolecules at the nanometre scale within a large specimen volume. Thus, our understanding of nanoscale biology within our three-dimensional cells is limited by the performance of current microscopes. This project aims to use cutting-edge technology in applied optics and micro-technology to design and build advanced microscopes for the study of fundamental biological processes at the molecular level. Inside the cell, biomolecules such as DNA and proteins have important functions. Yet, there is much to learn: how are these biomolecules transported inside the cell, how do they interact, and how are genes expressed? New knowledge about how cells operate can be used to develop better therapies against disease and improve health. The recent success of mRNA-based therapies is one example. State-of-the-art instrumentation would provide economic and commercial benefits to Australia, in addition to social and health benefits gained from a greater understanding of molecular processes in cells. The new instrumentation will be widely reported through relevant scientific and industry networks to find a pathway to commercialisation.",

We urgently need new ways to reduce the environmental and economic damage these herbivores cause. Plant odours provide crucial information herbivores use to find and decide which plants to eat, and artificial odours mimicking informative odours can alter this process. But key fundamental questions need answering to create odours that efficiently and predictably use or distort information to reduce damage. How closely must artificial odours match informative plant odours to be effective? Does plant quality alter the response of herbivores to these odours? Our project aims to answer these two questions and then go the next step, in applying this knowledge to a real word problem. We will test the strategic use of artificial odour as misinformation so herbivores ignore valued plants. With this new approach, our work will overcome the current stalemate in developing better management tools, urgently needed to deliver on current government strategies and initiatives to protect valuable plants across environmental and economic contexts. We can then work with end-users to translate our findings into practical methods and tools, helping restore biodiversity, sequester carbon, protect threatened plant species and reduce economic loss.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Seismology is a critical technology for discovering minerals as well as environmental monitoring, transport monitoring, planetary studies, security monitoring and explosion detection. Conventional seismometers can only measure 3 of the 6 components of seismic waves, which means that they cannot determine the wave directions and determine where the signals are coming from. This limitation is normally overcome by using tens to hundreds of seismometers in a huge array. If the three missing components are measured, a single seismic station can “see” where seismic waves are coming from using simple algorithms that convert the data into source maps. The concept has been proven, but there are no PORTABLE rotation sensors with sufficient sensitivity to measure the missing components. This project will fill this gap, creating instruments that include high-sensitivity rotation sensors that will allow a single instrument station to replace the huge arrays of seismometers currently used. The instrument itself will be of significant commercial value, while its applications in Australia are enormous. Introducing rotational seismology will disrupt conventional seismology by providing a dramatic new tool that will improve all aspects of seismology and make it much easier to apply, thereby benefiting all the current seismic applications and opening up new ones. It will pave the way for a harvest of new knowledge in all branches of seismology.",

These pores serve as portals for the delivery of (toxic) proteins into the target cell, leading to cell death. How these pores function to deliver the right protein into the right cell is poorly understood. The aim of our project is to reveal at the molecular level, how pores assemble and select proteins for translocation. We will also investigate the mechanism used to translocate proteins through the pore. Understanding these processes requires cutting-edge imaging technology and gives us a ‘blueprint’ for developing new and efficient systems for delivery of cargo proteins across cell membranes. This advance in knowledge has potential applications for Australia’s nanotechnology industry for engineering pores used in biosensors and sequencing technologies. It will also give us unprecedented insight into molecular machinery deployed by bacteria that cause significant disease in humans and livestock, relevant to the Australian health sector and primary industries. We will communicate our findings widely to scientists and engineers via open access peer-reviewed publications and conference proceeding, and to the general public via the university’s social media platforms.",

This cutting-edge research will address national research priorities in Advanced Manufacturing and Powering Australia. A new generation of clean energy technology for splitting water into hydrogen under solar light will bring significant economic and environmental benefit, underpinning new research capability and applied industry-relevant renewable technology for Australia. Additionally, the extensive training of PhD students and early career researchers will be critical for Australian research and the development for commercialising new, internationally competitive clean energy and environmental technologies.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Using a student voice approach, the proposed research will capture an important gap in knowledge concerning what boys and young men want in their wellbeing education.  We know many males will not seek help for issues related to poor well-being due to societal stigmas.  The research is of social and economic benefit as it intends to develop resources which may be used to reduce the stigma and foster a productive conversation at the community and national level.    Presently, school-based wellbeing programs remain almost exclusively gender-neutral, externally designed and implemented using a top-down approach.   For many boys and young men, these programs are ineffective.  The information gained will hopefully be useful to the future of wellbeing education for boys and young men.  In accordance with the ARC Medical Research Policy, the resources generated from the project are not an intervention and will not diagnose, monitor or manage the treatment of mental illness.  The project does not modify a human health condition or behaviour of humans and it is not a clinical trial. ",

Recently, there have been significant concerns regarding what boys and young men are exposed to online and how it may influence their social and emotional development.  The rise of the digital has led to new concerns regarding cyberbullying, body image dysmorphia, self-harm, depression, extremism, social anxiety and suicide.  There is a need to learn more about what boys and young men are consuming online and how they interpret it.  The proposed research aims to discover new knowledge regarding masculinities/boyhood in an era of technology-mediated societal transformations with a diverse cohort of boys and young men.

Increasingly, they are drawing upon online content to define masculine norms and gender dynamics which has issues for the increase in issues with misogyny, extremism, and gendered violence.  Yet very little research has attempted to understand how boys and young men consume digital spaces, to understand how they critically analyse their digital lifeworlds and what this means for their identities, relationships and wellbeing.  The new knowledge gained from the project will capture how a diverse cohort of boys and young men navigate digital environments allowing educators, parents/caregivers and policymakers to make informed decisions about the e-safety of Australian boys.  In discovering new knowledge, the project will raise awareness and foster a national conversation beyond academia. The research is student voice-driven and aims to discover new knowledge around an issue of significant concern we know little about.  In accordance with the ARC Medical Research Policy, this is not an intervention and will not diagnose, monitor or manage the treatment of mental illness.  The proposed research may contribute to the National Research Priority of 'Health', specifically ‘building healthy and resilient communities’ as we hope to gain insight into how boys and young men can effectively safeguard themselves in digital spaces.

Australia distributes millions of 1080 poison baits each year to control these pests but there are growing concerns over 1) impacts to non-target animals 2) the likelihood that pest animals are becoming resistant to the toxin and 3) humaneness. 1080 contains fluoroacetate, a natural plant toxin found in some native Australian plants. Native wildlife vary considerably in their tolerance to 1080 depending on evolutionary exposure but introduced pest species are highly sensitive as they did not evolve in Australia. Our project will 1) develop the first genetic test for 1080 tolerance, eliminating the need for lethal and inhumane lab trials to determine the tolerance of native species to 1080. This will ensure baiting is conducted in areas where there will be minimal impact on native wildlife 2) determine if pest species are becoming resistant to 1080 poison in areas where it has been heavily used over decades. If resistance is occurring then baiting practices may need to be changed to ensure pests can be controlled effectively 3)  search for alternative, more humane natural plant toxins to control cats and foxes. Our results will ensure plant toxins can be used safely and humanely by farmers and land managers to control pests into the future for the protection of livestock and wildlife. ",

This project aims to utilise atomic-resolution in-situ deformation transmission electron microscopy to unravel the mechanisms governing the mechanical behaviours of metallic materials. The mechanical properties of materials depend on their atomic-scale deformation responses under stress. These deformation behaviours are further influenced by local microstructures, a relationship that remains inadequately comprehended. Successful completion of the project will reveal how different microstructural features of materials impact their mechanical properties. This should guide the design of metallic structures with optimal mechanical performance, offering substantial benefits to Australian metallurgical and related industries.",

The outcomes of this project will guide the future design of ultra-strong and tough metallic materials, enhancing the competitiveness of Australia’s metallurgical industry. This could lead to the development of lighter and more energy-efficient vehicles, making road travel more cost-effective for Australians, reducing environmental impact, and promoting sustainable transportation solutions.\nTo maximise the understanding, translation, use, and adoption of the research beyond academia, we will engage with industry partners, participate in public outreach initiatives, and disseminate findings through various media channels and industry conferences. Collaborations with manufacturing firms and policy makers will be sought to ensure practical application and commercial development of the new knowledge.",

The influence of classical Epicureanism on Western thought has been obscured by the fact that Epicurean ideas were often imported covertly due to the threat they posed to the established church. Further, many have laboured under the mistaken belief that the Epicureans had little to offer by way of political or economic thought. This project aims to explore how Epicureanism impacted the British contribution to early modern political liberalism, classical political economy, and utilitarianism by assessing how it affected the works of 7 key thinkers (Hobbes, Locke, Mandeville, Hume, Smith, Bentham, and Mill).

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Epicureanism,  the ancient philosophy of the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain, has had a profound impact on Western culture; yet it is little understood. In excavating this key intellectual current that helped transform Western culture from a rigid, religious, tradition to a dynamic one based on rationalistic and individualistic principles, the project will enhance understanding of the Western moral, political, economic, and legal way of life. In short, it will illuminate the story of how and why we live now and provide knowledge that helps Western liberal culture reflect on, challenge, and reinvent itself. Social benefit accrues, not only from sharing Epicurean teachings for the good life, but from placing Australian scholarship at the forefront of a field dominated by European and North American scholars, enhancing Australia's image as a knowledge economy that exports ideas to the world. Such work, culminating in a Year 3 workshop with national and international experts, will enhance the prestige of our tertiary education sector, of considerable value to a country where higher education is a major export industry. The project will also train a PhD student and ECR, mentoring them to develop their research and supervision track records. Findings will be accessible to the public through an Open Access monograph, a website, as well as a podcast series, The Everyday Epicurean, which will share the teachings of Epicureanism on living a happy and contented life.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Emerging RNA-based technologies, such as mRNA vaccines, are revolutionising the biotechnology and therapeutics sectors. However, we still do not understand how different types of RNA are made and processed by cells. There has been massive global investment into a new class of RNA, circular RNA (circRNA) because they are more durable than mRNA. However, key features of how circRNAs function remain unknown which is a major barrier to harnessing them for technological purposes. Our proposal aims to provide the first insights into an entirely new pathway responsible for the nuclear export of circRNAs. Uncovering the key proteins in circRNA production and transport and understanding their regulation will be key to fulfilling the tremendous potential for circRNAs in the next generation of RNA based technologies. Our study will impact research on a global scale and the fundamental knowledge we aim to generate has the potential to lead to employment and study opportunities for young scientists in Australia and internationally. Our studies will help keep Australian science at the forefront of discovery of molecular mechanisms in this area. At a societal level, future applications of the fundamental knowledge generated here may include new ways to improve the efficiency of these emerging RNA based technologies and therapies in plants and animals. We will promote our findings through publication in journals with suitable open access policies, press releases and through social media.",

We broadly understand the interplay between these factors but the specifics of the leads, lags and timing result in significant uncertainties about future global projections. This project investigates catastrophic and abrupt sea-level rise (several to tens of metres) from ice sheet retreat, what impact annual global climate change (i.e. global warming) has on seasonal-interannual climate phenomena (i.e. droughts, floods and marine heat waves), and how coral reef ecosystems respond to these changes. To investigate these parameters the project draws on insights from drowned fossil reefs offshore Hawaii, a site that preserves a detailed and globally unique history of change over the past 500,000 years. The project outcomes apply globally, including for Australia’s coastal zone and the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef. The national and international significance of our project is underpinned by a $27 million investment by the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) to collect the fossil reef samples we will utilise.",

However, the sound systems of its languages are greatly under-studied. This project aims to produce the first-ever large-scale study of speech sounds of Papuan languages. Compared to major European languages (from which most knowledge of speech production has been generated), Papuan languages tend to have very simple sound systems but show a tremendous amount more variability. Studying the potentials and limitations of this extreme variability will generate a much deeper understanding of the human capacity for speech. A highly significant outcome of this research will be a series of digital dictionaries, including audio recordings, produced in consultation with native language speakers and freely available online. This co-creation approach will ensure effective communication of the research outcomes to stakeholders. Other benefits of this project will be to help preserve these languages and reverse the language loss that is a legacy of colonization, and to help strengthen cross-cultural communication and foster understanding with one of our most important neighbours. Further, a better understanding of speech production has potential clinical implications for the treatment of speech disorders and for improving language technologies, which are currently mostly trained on major world languages.",

This project will (1) describe the impact that male caregivers have on the growth and development of their children’s wellbeing across time and how this may predict wellbeing in later life, (2) identify the differing patterns of male caregiver involvement with their children across time and how this may predict wellbeing in later life, (3) identify the practical constraints and limitations within the family home and workplace that impact on how male caregivers contribute to their children’s mental health and wellbeing, and (4) utilise these findings to produce policy and service recommendations needed by governments, services, communities, and families. This project will deliver evidence to support Australian child and family policies (e.g., National Children’s Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy) around the engagement of fathers and male caregivers in their children’s lives, thereby maximising benefits to children's long-term wellbeing and developmental outcomes. This work will be guided by the input of community partners and build the nation’s capacity for ongoing research excellence through supporting early and mid-career researchers. ",

(2) National security: A recent hacking attack on the Australian Parliament Servers is closely related to the vulnerable password-based authentication. (3) Social life: Most recently, hacking has occurred in Australia’s medical system where hackers stole sensitive medical data and demanded a ransom from a company that managed millions of digital scripts a year. One underlying security issue is that the password cannot authenticate genuine users. While biometrics can authenticate genuine users, biometrics' privacy needs protection. Furthermore, existing biometrics authentication provides little support for the encryption function that is widely used in our daily life for cyber security. Bio-cryptography is an emerging technology that can combine the powers of biometrics and cryptography. However, the emerging quantum computing technology is expected to break completely many commonly used cryptography-based security systems.  This project will develop a post-quantum bio-cryptosystem to address this technology gap.  The outcomes of this project will provide a powerful tool to mitigate the identity crimes in Australia that have cost billions of dollars financial loss annually, threatened national security, and social suffering to Australians' privacy breaches. The project outcomes will be disseminated via a project website, and social media.",

We can’t seem to agree any more on many fundamental issues and consensus-finding – essential to a healthy democracy – becomes ever more difficult. Most worryingly, it is not just that we disagree on many questions of general concern; with notions of truth and truthfulness themselves becoming contested we seem at risk of losing our shared grip of ‘the real’ and factual. This project speaks to these problems. It reveals what is at stake in the current situation by returning to ancient Greece as the time and place when notions of truth and truthfulness were first ‘discovered’ in the history of the West. By exploring the circumstances surrounding the emergence of truth as a problem among certain ancient Greek thinkers it helps us to understand what is at stake in the current situation and what would be lost if we give up on our joint commitment of the factual and real now. Findings of the project will not only be shared with the wider public in public-facing lectures, articles, and workshops, members of the public will also be directly involved in the project through a series of ‘humanities salons’ housed at Sydney University.

Recent regulatory changes provide little insight into how aged care services can provide person centred care that meets consumer needs. Furthermore, past and current efforts to understand consumer needs rely on summary measures of care experiences and treat residential aged care as a single service rather than a collection of services. This project will overcome these limitations and generate large scale data on consumer experiences and preferences for residential aged care using an innovative approach.\n\nWe will use participatory citizen science and co-design, with consumers, a crowdsourcing platform to capture consumer experiences and preferences in near real-time, using infection management as an exemplar. A key outcome will be a replicable model for elucidating consumer experiences and preferences for a range of care types. Social benefits will flow from improved aged care services, a right of all Australians. Reductions in economic losses from antimicrobial resistance due to antibiotic overuse may follow in the future. We will leverage our connections with industry (e.g. aged care providers, IT vendors), government (e.g. Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission) and nongovernment organisations (e.g. Consumers Health Forum of Australia) to disseminate the research findings and promote adoption of the research.

    "summary": "Inside the jury: A novel experimental technique to study jury deliberation. Despite decades of psychology research, we know almost nothing about what happens inside the jury room. Jury decision making is an inherently collaborative process in which groups discuss the evidence while trying to achieve a verdict. However most jury research has ignored the deliberation process, only studying the decisions of individual participants. This failure to adequately model deliberation has profound implications for justice. This project will use a novel method to allow experimental investigation of aspects of the deliberation process to address important questions such as whether juries are self-correcting and whether they can follow judicial instructions. Results will inform policy and legal procedure around the world.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Current psychological studies inadequately address jury deliberation dynamics. This project establishes a new paradigm for future jury deliberation studies, for framing effective judicial directions and facilitating juries’ capacity to self-correct error. Currently the law assumes, without foundation, that jurors follow judges’ directions and that jury deliberations correct error and misunderstanding. Yet cases reveal jurors fail to follow judicial directions to avoid accessing error-prone social media or engage in other ‘research’. This project’s novel experimental psychology design provides for the first time robust testing of critical assumptions underpinning jury deliberations. Its evidence-based knowledge will inform key legal processes and policies promoting juries’ application of fair trial principles, including making judicial guidance effective and determining the efficacy of judges’ directions in other contexts. This improved understanding of the psychology of jury deliberation will ensure trial by jury, the gold standard of adjudication for people charged with the most serious of crimes, is enhanced and modernised, and reducing flawed jury verdicts will lead to fewer aborted trials, unnecessary appeals, quashed convictions, and fewer defendants and crime victims enduring retrials. It will minimise incalculable, unnecessary trauma and costly wasted court resources creating a potential impact on jury trial policies of national significance. ",

This project aims to develop a novel co-extrusion technique for 3DCP, integrating flexural fibre-reinforced polymer grid reinforcement. The project seeks to leverage alkali-activated slag binder as a sustainable alternative to Portland cement, with significantly lower CO2 emissions and excellent early age strength required for high-quality 3DCP. Expected outcomes include innovative techniques for reinforced 3DCP and optimized models for strain-graded concrete.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The Australian construction sector faces a significant challenge with high labour expenses, which 3D printed concrete (3DPC) aims to address by reducing costs and speeding up construction. However, the widespread adoption of 3DPC encounters obstacles, particularly in effectively implementing reinforcement. Additionally, the environmental impact of cement production, emitting a staggering two billion tons of CO2 annually, highlights the need for sustainable alternatives. This project pioneers a novel co-extrusion technique for 3DPC, integrating flexural fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) grid reinforcement and utilising alkaline-activated concrete (AAC) from industrial waste to replace ordinary Portland cement (OPC). By promoting FRP reinforcement with its corrosion resistance, high strength-to-weight ratio, and superior electromagnetic properties, the project introduces innovation to 3DPC. This approach explores new ground in FRP-reinforced 3DPC. The environmental impact is twofold: creating a new market by utilising slag waste while reducing the environmental impact of increasing waste production. Furthermore, substituting OPC with AAC promises to cut CO2 emissions, contributing to a more environmentally friendly construction sector. To promote the research beyond academia, pilot projects, field trials and workshops demonstrating the practical applications of the developed technologies will be carried out through collaboration with construction firms to reach a broader audience.",

To address this, policymakers are emphasising the need to reskill existing workers. However, there is uncertainty about where and how this reskilling should happen and who stands to benefit. This project will identify the barriers and opportunities related to reskilling in three locations in regional Australia, considering a mix of social, cultural, and economic factors. Understanding these dynamics at the household, community and regional levels is crucial for ensuring an inclusive transition in the workforce. The insights gained from this project will not only promote a fairer distribution of reskilling opportunities across different demographics but will also help mitigate negative effects on Australian households, communities and regions by expanding employment opportunities. The findings will be shared through a comprehensive report and an industry summit involving relevant policymakers, industry representatives, and support organisations to improve skilled employment outcomes. A targeted social media animation and an online exhibition will engage individuals interested in reskilling.",

This project aims to investigate marine organism responses to ecosystem change around Antarctica by using an innovative approach of sedimentary ancient DNA, evolutionary and population genetics. New knowledge will be generated on rates at which keystone marine organisms (e.g., phytoplankton, Antarctic krill) adapt to environmental change. Expected outcomes include the most comprehensive, circum-Antarctic sedimentary ancient DNA dataset to date providing marine ecosystem evolution information spanning, at least, 1 million years. Integrating this with population genetics surveys on modern organisms will allow improved predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change, ultimately benefitting targeted conservation efforts in Antarctica.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Climate change is causing marine ecosystem shifts around the globe. Identifying the capacity of marine organisms to adapt to such changes is a matter of urgency. One of the most vulnerable regions to climate change is Antarctica, where ice cap melting and warming ocean temperatures are starting to have catastrophic impacts both locally on marine ecosystems and globally through sea-level rise. Palaeo-records offer a powerful means to learn important lessons about past ecosystem evolution. This research will use a novel combination of ancient DNA from marine sediments and evolutionary genomics to infer how and how fast species around Antarctica, including commercially fished Antarctic krill, evolve and adapt to climate change. Such knowledge will help to manage marine resources in Antarctica effectively. The project aligns with the Australian Government’s Science and Research Priority of monitoring ‘Environmental Change’ and represents a state-of-the-art genetics tool to address the National Marine Science 2015-2025 Research Plan Grand Challenge ‘Climate Change Adaptation’. We will train five early career scientists, thereby contributing to building Australia’s future research workforce. This project leverages nine previous Antarctic expeditions that already had high publicity, which we will build on by bringing this research to the public via talks, blogs, videos, and social media.",

This will one day provide Australians with more secure communications technologies and better health outcomes through the early detection of pathogens and diseases. The materials and fundamental science developed throughout the project will bridge the gap between emerging diamond-based quantum technologies and cutting-edge telecommunications and sensing technologies. This will enable technological innovation and support Australia’s ambitions for economic growth in quantum technologies, and it may provide Australia with strategic defence capabilities in the long term. The project team will participate in the Australian Centre for Quantum Growth program and events and programs run by the Defence Science & Technology Group to promote project outcomes to end users in telecommunications, biomedicine, and defence.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project addresses an urgent and serious animal welfare issue that is rapidly decimating our native wombat population. Sarcoptic mange, a parasitic infection caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite, is responsible for hundreds of wombat deaths every year and has led to declines in the wombat population of up to 94% across regions in Australia. Without effective treatment, infected wombats suffer a slow and painful death, usually within 2-3 months. Sarcoptic mange is treatable with antiparasitic drugs. However, current formulations of these drugs are not optimal – with a high failure rate resulting from poor topical drug penetration and absorption through the fur and thickened/crusted skin barriers. The ‘run off’ that occurs contaminates the environment and can potentially lead to mites (and other species) acquiring resistance to the antiparasitic drug. This project aims to develop improved antiparasitic formulations using innovative pharmaceutical approaches that can effectively treat sarcoptic mange infected wombats, without the need to handle or capture the animals. Outcomes will improve disease management for Australian native animals and reduce the threat of environmental contamination. Improved treatment provides significant benefits for wildlife conservation and animal welfare and may be adapted for the treatment of other infectious diseases. ",

The project will address critical gaps in our knowledge of three glycine receptor (GlyR) types, which have fundamental roles in movement (GlyR alpha1), brain development (GlyR alpha2), pain sensing and breathing (GlyR alpha3). The project will leverage unique antibodies and mouse models to uncover the critical components of all three GlyR complexes. Initial work has uncovered >20 new proteins associated with GlyR alpha2beta complexes, including a membrane microprotein that could fundamentally alter our view of GlyR biology. We now need to understand how this protein influences GlyR function, and whether similar proteins associate with GlyR alpha1 and alpha3. Our project will advance fundamental knowledge that will be of wide-ranging interest to scientists and the general public. Our findings will be promoted via the international synaptic gene annotation initiative SynGO, which will maximise translation, use, and adoption of the research findings, as well as enhancing the international reputation of Australian scientific research. The project will also train the next generation of researchers in advanced proteomic methods, electrophysiology and super-resolution microscopy, which will provide economic and commercial benefits to Australian science and biotechnology sectors.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Varroa destructor mites are major threat to honeybees, as they transmit viral pathogens that lead to devastating losses of honeybee colonies. Honeybees are critical to honey and beeswax production, as well as production of over 35 important agricultural crops that rely on honeybees for pollination (e.g., almonds, avocados, apples, blueberries, mangoes). The recent Varroa invasion in Australia poses a significant threat to Australian agricultural and horticultural industries, with billion-dollar impacts. Current methods of Varroa control are inadequate to contain the spread of these mites in Australia, with limited treatments available, and development of resistance likely. We will develop new chemical and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) treatments for controlling Varroa, using combination of molecular, functional and computational approaches to design compounds that target key receptors in the Varroa nervous system while leaving honeybees unharmed. Our project will contribute to global efforts aimed at reducing the impact of the Varroa mite and is translatable to other parasitic arthropods. Communication will be through traditional academic pathways, as well as to key stakeholders in the honeybee, agriculture and horticulture sectors. Communicating early results will open up potential translation pathways with industry partners, bringing significant benefits to the Australian economy by providing novel lead chemical or dsRNA-based miticides for commercialisation.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project constitutes the first major study of how diversity is ‘done’ in Australia’s media sector, and the opportunities and barriers it presents for media employment, workers’ safety and wellbeing, and social and cultural representation. Producing evidence of how diversity is defined and pursued within news organisations, and learning from the practices and experience of media workers, it will inform robust and sustainable solutions to problems of exclusion, discrimination and harm. This supports social inclusion in the media industry, a key contributor to national culture, and generates knowledge and debate of significance for other industry sectors. Through sharing and discussing its findings in public fora, including in and through media itself, the project will provoke public engagement and reflection on the adequacy of existing diversity policies and practices. Enabling informed reflection works to promote the benefits of enhanced inclusion, supporting all Australians to fully and safely participate in the social, cultural and economic life of the nation. The project also, importantly, contributes to and facilitates international research, extending and enhancing Australia’s reputation as a nation that supports all citizens to contribute to national life without discrimination, and regardless of cultural, ethnic or gender identity, sexuality or disability.",

The project aims to determine the cellular mechanisms regulating the solubility of proteins inside mammalian cells, which are poorly understood and, when they fail, lead to neurodegenerative diseases. The project expects to determine what features of proteins dictate how they aggregate inside cells and the patterns in proteins sensed by protein quality control networks that work to prevent protein aggregation from arising. Expected outcomes include illuminating critical cell biology pathways underpinning molecular responses to protein folding, aggregation, and stress. This should provide significant benefits to future research into cures for neurodegeneration and industries producing engineered proteins, such as antibodies and enzymes.\n\n",

Proteins, in particular, act as molecular machines to operate every function required for life. Yet, most proteins are complex and fragile, quickly malfunctioning when cells are stressed, diseased, or manipulated upon genetic engineering of cells or organisms. We need to understand more about how proteins are kept functional in cells. This project aims to fill gaps in understanding of the approaches cells have evolved to keep their proteins healthy and functional, knowledge that Australians will benefit from. One benefit is agri-food industries in Australia exploiting them to improve the efficiency of protein yield and quality in industrial applications involving proteins. Another benefit is establishing foundations for future research to maintain Australians’ healthy brains during aging and in neurodegenerative diseases which feature protein dysfunction/clumping and are a leading cause of death of Australians. Practical benefits include more efficient ways to manufacture protein-based products and therapeutics – products widely consumed by Australians. The team will publicise the findings of key discoveries to Australian and international media outlets (TV, online and newsprint through the university marketing and communication office) and through direct liaison with biotech companies who might be interested to use the knowledge.

Each element will address existing challenges such as polarisation mismatch, scanning speed, surface reflection and penetration depth. In this system the phase front of the electromagnetic wave emitted by the antenna is shaped using a lens and the surface of the material being tested is given a specialised anti-reflection coating. This two-stage process ensures the emitted wave has sufficient directed power and is effectively transmitted inside the material to reach deep targets.

The existing non-destructive testing methods use a wide range of probing signals including radio waves, sound waves, electric currents, X-ray or gamma rays, or a combination of methods to wirelessly detect sub-surface anomalies in an object or medium such as ground. The variety of measurement conditions multiplies the cost by requiring maintaining a fleet of different instruments to monitor a wide range of infrastructure objects. \n\nThis project aims to develop a design methodology that will facilitate the design of a generic modular non-destructive microwave-based testing system for different scanning environments. These challenges will be addressed in the form of interchangeable bespoke components to steer and focus the probing beam, while reducing surface reflections, allowing deeper testing with radar-based analysis instruments. \n\nBy developing a scanning system that can be adapted to its test environment, the project will improve the convenience and reliability of non-destructive testing. This will enhance public safety by enabling more frequent and accurate inspection of critical infrastructure such as bridges or underground pipes, thus significantly reducing the risk of failures and accidents. This will support informed decision-making on maintenance budget, and timelines for development of new standards by regulatory authorities and commissioning partners.",

This project proposes a novel approach to analyse the resilience of animals to heat waves with different rates and magnitudes of temperature change. Innovative science is the foundation for effective environmental management. The outcomes of this project will help build the foundation for next-generation environmental management particularly by providing a mathematical model as a diagnostic tool. The model is calibrated with experimental data and can predict the resilience of animals to climate heating events. Inputs can include experimental data, and measured or predicted climate data. Identifying areas of particular vulnerability will improve effectiveness of funding allocations for management interventions, which will be of economic and environmental benefit for Australia. We will target conservation and management forums (journals, meetings, organisations) to publicise the applied aspect of this project. The project will foster national and international research collaboration between investigators and their laboratories, and the resultant staff and student training will be of social and economic benefits to Australia. \n\n",

In modern critical workplaces (e.g., defence, cyber-security, aviation, manufacturing, health care, mining, oil/gas) humans are increasingly required to work with automated advice to make decisions. The project aims to produce a unified computational model that provides lawful explanations and quantitative predictions for how humans use automated advice, including in task contexts with increased risk of automation-use error. Project outcomes are expected to guide the design and evaluation of automated systems and inform work design and training. The project will provide training for early-career researchers and students, expanding Australia’s capability at the increasingly critical intersection of Human Factors and Mathematical Psychology.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "As modern workplaces become more cognitively complex (e.g., defence, cyber-security, aviation, manufacturing, healthcare, process control), Australia’s economic productivity and public safety increasingly depends upon humans working alongside automated technologies. However, adopting automation in work systems without understanding its effects on human decision-making poses risks, particularly in safety-critical workplaces. This project will develop a unified computational model that provides lawful explanations and quantitative predictions regarding the psychological processes by which humans use automated advice. This unified model can then be used to inform the design and evaluation of current and future automated decision aids. It can also inform how human operators in modern-work task contexts are trained to work with decision aids. By advancing our understanding of the psychological processes underlying how humans use automated advice, the project outcomes can deliver a competitive advantage to critical modern work sectors, and further Australia’s reputation for cutting-edge research that extends basic science to applied work domains. This project will also provide first-class training for early career researchers, expanding Australia’s future research capability in applying mathematical psychology to addressing a range of human factors challenges in the modern workplace.",

Current approaches to managing ‘eco-emotions’ focus on lowering the intensity of feelings about climate change at an individual level. These approaches are not scalable and risk dampening the emotional fire needed to fuel action on climate change. This project recognises the opportunity in eco-emotions and aims to harness their power to promote climate action. It will achieve this aim while launching a world-first investigation of eco-emotions using experience sampling—a technique capable of modelling emotion dynamics in the course of people’s everyday lives. Key outcomes include new literature on functional and flexible regulation of emotions, new methods for assessing social behaviour in situ, and enhanced knowledge of how to channel eco-emotions into climate action while also preserving personal well-being. These outcomes will be translated to relevant stakeholders through academic publications and presentations and community-based outreach in the form of public addresses, opinion pieces, and factsheets. Benefits will be social in the form of enhanced well-being, environmental in the form of collective action on climate change, capacity-enhancing in the training of research personnel, and intellectual in the generation of new knowledge that places Australia at the forefront of easing the emotional burden of the climate crisis.",

Our cutting-edge data processing and search algorithms, optimised for the vast fields-of-view and sensitivity of new radio telescopes, are unearthing a new population of these enigmatic objects. We propose to unravel their true nature by swiftly following up new detections with multiwavelength observations, and modelling the sources' evolutionary paths and magnetic field configurations.

This project will find more of these slowly repeating radio sources and follow them up using telescopes from around the world, to understand their nature. The proposal uses the unique capabilities of the Murchison Widefield Array and Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, radio telescopes located in outback Western Australia. The search will push the limits of the systems, testing observational and data-searching techniques which can then be used in the future Square Kilometre Array. These telescopes are top-level science infrastructure priorities of the 2016-2025 Australian Astronomy Decadal Plan, and this project is a low-cost way to expand the capabilities of existing investments, and make Australia a leader in this entirely new field of study, which is now an international hot topic. The novel astronomical discoveries we aim for will enhance international collaboration and, building on the proponents' already significant public outreach portfolio in television, radio, print and public events, further inspire public enthusiasm for STEM.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "In engineering structures, early-stage defects accumulate progressively under in-service conditions, leading to significant damage and eventual structural failure. Detection of defects is critical to ensure integrity and safety of a wide range of structures spanning the oil and gas, space, energy and power industries. Existing non-destructive inspection techniques are insensitive to early-stage defects and have very limited functionality for any structures with hard-to-inspect conditions, since these conditions pose challenges for ‘contact-based’ sensing. Our project will develop a breakthrough technology for non-contact and reliable non-destructive inspection of early-stage defects to overcome these key limitations. Harnessing laser ultrasonics, this technology will significantly improve capability, sophistication and practicability over current inspection techniques for high-value structures. The project outcomes will contribute to Australian priority areas in Transport and Energy by transforming integrity assessment and optimising maintenance of high-value assets, as well as increasing the competitiveness of Australian manufacturing. Alongside public dissemination, our findings will be communicated to a range of government agencies and research organisations through high-impact journals, conferences and workshops. This will expand Australia’s knowledge base and capabilities in non-destructive safety inspection and enhance our leadership in this strategic area of research.",

One of the most pressing issues is the \"Hubble Tension\" in which different techniques of measuring the Universe's expansion rate disagree. Building on two decades of Australian leadership in galaxy surveys, this project aims to use our established access to world-leading data to make the most comprehensive map of our local Universe - and thus reveal whether hidden structure has biased expansion measurements, or whether a step-change in our cosmological model is needed.\n\nThis project aims to create the most breath-taking map of our Universe to date. By collaborating with software engineers, we plan to release our data as a downloadable resource for all cosmologists in perpetuity and as a public app- and web-based \"Cosmic Atlas\" (like a \"Google Maps\" for the Universe). This will provide a real way of achieving the Government's vision of engaging and inspiring the Australian community about science, and cultural benefit will flow from the public's ability to explore the wonders of our nearby Universe. Through leadership in major international surveys the project aims to create long-term collaborations and leave a legacy to enhance Australia's capacity for future astrophysics discoveries. Economic benefits are expected to follow from enabling the next generation of innovators to develop new tools for industry and data science.",

Concerns about fairness are a key element of community attitudes towards new transmission projects. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to ensure that public engagement, policies and laws on transmission adopt fair processes and deliver just outcomes for communities. To respond to this need, this project aims to develop new strategies for a just and coherent approach to constructing electricity transmission infrastructure in Australia.\n\nThrough socio-legal analysis of Federal and State legislation and policy, and case studies of two proposed transmission projects in New South Wales and Victoria, the project will yield economic and environmental benefits by identifying practical and authentic steps to strengthen public support for accelerated investment in renewable energy. This will enhance the prospects of success for major initiatives such as the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation plan. The project will also yield social benefits by identifying ways to bridge rural-urban divides over energy policy. We will partner with local communities throughout the project, and project outcomes will be shared through policy briefs, videos, submissions to government inquiries and a practical guide for community members.",

However, given there are still approximately 500 new cases per year and 30,000 people currently living with HIV in Australia, questions remain about the risks to HIV prevention from messaging that suggests elimination is imminent. Using an innovative and interdisciplinary approach that combines policy, biomedical and social aspects, this project will generate urgently needed new knowledge about the effects of global public health’s focus on elimination on understandings of HIV risk and experiences of stigma. In doing so, it will identify factors likely to support the success of this ambitious goal and provide an understanding of the potential dangers of virtual elimination in specific areas in the context of global mobility and the interconnectedness of communities. This new knowledge will inform HIV policy in Australia and internationally, supporting prevention and reducing costs of HIV care, and provide social benefits by identifying the dynamics of HIV-related stigma in the contemporary era. It will also offer lessons for other areas of infectious disease public policy. To support translation of the findings, outcomes will be communicated via knowledge-translation workshops with policy makers and health-promotion practitioners, and by direct communication with affected communities.",

This cell category has long been considered a passive relay, providing raw signals to the brain, which then assembles perception and sends descending signals back to the spinal cord support survival. In contrast, the cells that we have discovered give rise to an extensive collateral branching system in the spinal cord, allowing them to distribute an early ascending survival signal. This application will define the connectivity and function of these unique nerve cells with benefits including bio-inspired applications in control theory, computing, engineering, and robotics; as well as livestock and endangered species management.",

These investments acknowledge the potential for neuroscience research to deliver major benefits in many areas including health, innovation and quality of life; as well as bio-inspired applications for industry across control systems, computing, engineering, and robotics. The current research proposal seeks to capitalise on and contribute to the technical and theoretical advances flowing from international efforts by advancing our understanding of how the spinal cord uses sensory information to provide early damage/threat control signals not previously appreciated. The innovative approaches to be employed will offer a new perspective on the neural mechanisms underlying spinal sensory processing and how this level of processing precedes and interacts with descending signals from the brain. Communication of these research findings will support Australia’s international standing and be of major benefit to neuroscientists studying how sensory information is processed by the central nervous system. The inclusion of early career researchers, graduate and undergraduate students in the project will also help to keep Australia at the forefront of neuroscience innovation, ensuring these future research leaders are trained in the leading-edge technologies needed to progress our understanding of brain function.

Nonetheless, our knowledge of the lasting impact that Australian colonialism had on current socio-economic outcomes is scarce. Unraveling the dynamics of foundational periods is crucial for understanding the root causes of current socio-economic disparities among Australians. This novel project exploits the power of merging large-scale data and text from historical records, censuses, gazettes, and newspapers in Australia and the UK, together with current Australian surveys, to measure the impact that maritime travel mortality, colonialists’ characteristics, and sentiments expressed in such documents had on the socio-economic outcomes of Australians up to the present day. We create an unprecedented, user-friendly, Open Access dataset, fostering high-quality projects in all social sciences globally, and accessible to history teachers and the public, expanding the evidence-based knowledge and views that Australians have about their history, and possibly impacting Australian school curriculums. In addition, this project supports mentoring of undergraduate, PhD, and early career researchers, thereby enhancing Australia’s research capabilities. The results of this project will be disseminated widely among the community through open access news articles, anticipated high levels of media attention, and public events and workshops in collaboration with state libraries and historical societies.",

This project aims to ‘harvest’ the basic fluorine synthons (F-, F2, F+) from waste fluorocarbons to circumvent the need for hazardous fluorine reagents and recycle the fluorine that has already been incorporated into existing fluorocarbons. The success of this project will result in new methods for transfer fluorination and a new family of carbon-based fluorination reagents that will be readily commercializable.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Fluorocarbons are essential components of many modern chemicals used by Australians including refrigerants, soaps, cosmetics, plastics, pesticides, herbicides and pharmaceuticals. As potent pollutants, the megatons of fluorocarbon waste generated each year present a significant environmental hazard and Australia has committed to limiting the release of fluorocarbon waste as a signatory of the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols. Most fluorochemicals industry (worth over $100 billion/year) is foreign with limited Australian capability for producing new fluorocarbons or processing fluorocarbon waste. This project aims to invent new methods to harvest fluorine from waste fluorocarbons and then transfer it to other compounds to generate new fluorochemicals (waste-to-asset). Such a technological development would allow Australia to become a major economic benefactor of the global fluorochemicals market and lead to several customised commercial fluorinating reagents. It would also reduce Australia’s dependence on foreign fluorochemical imports and provide a new avenue for the recycling of fluorocarbon waste. Discoveries arising from this project will be patented and communicated in open access media to ensure that the benefits of this project remain within Australia and that Australians are able to access and understand these scientific advances.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Gambling amongst children in Australia is emerging as a national crisis, with a 16% increase in the number of people under 18 seeking help for gambling in the past financial year. To combat this growing problem, State and Federal Governments are prioritising regulation that restricts children's access to gambling, but there are crucial gaps in the policy related to children's use of mobile devices. This project will generate an evidence-base of how children use mobile phones to access \"gamble-play\" via apps, social media and games that embed gambling mechanics, with and without explicit monetary transactions. Research with children aged 5-17 - including lab and home-based observation, interviews and workshops - will identify how mobile devices open \"gateways to gambling\" and determine how gambling-play behaviours escalate as children mature.  This evidence will inform evolving regulation around the intersections between gambling, children, and media, including tracking and identifying gaps in new videogame and social media policy. The project will provide social benefits through educational toolkits that support family literacies, co-designed with children and promoted through a national media plan. An Advisory Board of industry and policy experts will ensure strong uptake of the project’s white papers. Through initiatives such as a Gamble-Play Summit and regular Board consultation, these white papers will assist policymakers with the development of evidence-based regulation.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Bacteria cope with different environments and stresses by coordinating the transcription of specific sets of genes generally associated with related functions, resulting in a ‘fight’ or ‘flight’ response. In the ‘fight’ response, bacteria activate the transcription of genes that lead to enhanced fitness and survival in a specific condition, while the ‘flight’ response involves activation of motility genes to escape the condition. These adaptations enable bacteria to survive in industrial, environmental, animal production and clinical settings. Using advanced microbiology, molecular biology, biochemical and structural biology methods, this study will dissect how bacteria sense and respond to environmental stresses such as antibiotics, biocides, salts and metal ions. Enhanced understanding into the mechanisms that control bacterial adaptation to these stresses could lead to the development of new therapeutics to block resistance pathways used by pathogens that cause disease in veterinary and agricultural settings. This new knowledge has the potential for social and economic benefits, such as protecting Australia's food manufacturing and unique environmental ecosystems, as well as improving the well-being of Australians. Beyond its research implications, this project will create a range of high-skills training opportunities and has the potential to bolster multiple Australian industrial sectors, driving scientific and economic advancement.",

Yet, the United Nations' Convention of the Rights of a Child of which Australia is a signatory, is based on Eurocentric conceptions of childhood which are imposed uncritically on the rest of the world. Southeast Asian countries find these at odds with local culture, inhibiting them from helping marginalised children. Focusing on advocacy on behalf of disadvantaged childhoods in the Philippines, this project breaks away from Western-dominated views producing the first history of childhoods and the family from the Southeast Asian region. Benefits to Australia include an increased understanding of the childhoods of its non-European migrant populations, and new insights on methods for empowering children. By analysing strategies used to empower children in poverty, malnourished children, children abandoned by fathers and migrant children, it has the potential to influence policies including Australian development assistance. Understanding non-European perspectives on childhood also enables the Australian government to think differently about immigrant children and policy provisions for them. Through a published book, journal articles, museum exhibits, and online seminars with advocates and scholars in Australia and overseas, it hopes to contribute towards a truly global discussion of childhoods.\n",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Ammonia forms the cornerstone of modern agriculture as a fertilizer, and it has recently emerged as a promising solution for hydrogen storage and distribution—a key component of a net-zero emissions future. However, the current methods of industrial ammonia production operate under harsh conditions and are far from sustainable, accounting for 1-2% of global energy consumption and nearly 2% of carbon dioxide emissions. This project aims to tackle this challenge by developing a cost-effective approach to ammonia production, powered entirely by abundant solar energy in Australia. The rational design approach will be employed to address the insufficient charge conversion efficiency of the photoelectrodes and long-term stability challenge of the perovskite-based photoelectrode. With the new materials in hand, a novel stand-alone zero-gap photoelectrochemical electrolyser system using inexpensive aqueous electrode will be developed to enable sustainable ammonia manufacturing and mitigate the carbon footprint associated with ammonia production. The impact of this technology will be profound as it moves the Australian economy closer to zero-emission goals, provides a boost to the local advanced manufacturing, hydrogen export, and creates new skilled jobs.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Understanding how genes are expressed from our DNA is a fundamental research question in biology. The genes we express make us each unique. It’s what makes a brain cell different to a muscle cell. We know that the expression of our genes change as we age and this drives the decline in cognition and physical function as we get older. We also know that growth factors circulating in our body change across our lifespan, and these growth factors can control the expression of our genes. But the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown, as is how these growth factors control the expression of our genes as we age. Our research team have discovered a completely new mechanism of how growth factors regulate our genes. Furthermore, we show this new mechanism changes throughout the skeleton in the elderly. We study bone as this tissue is the scaffolding foundation of life and age-related deterioration results in frailty across all animals.  This project seeks to expand our knowledge and investigate if manipulating this new mechanism can limit the degenerative effects of ageing. This is highly relevant to Australia’s ageing population as maintaining skeletal function is key to movement and healthy ageing. It could also lead to better livestock production and athletic performance. We will share our results at national and international conferences, in leading journals and in community media outlets, social media and public events.",

Under these extreme conditions new collective quantum behaviour can arise such as the ability to flow without any friction – the atoms become a superfluid.  This project will design new methods to force superfluids to flow in a circuit by creating patterns of drains where the atoms are removed.  This will cause the superfluid flows to have previously unexplored features that could be utilised for new applications of superfluid circuits.\n\nUltracold atoms are extraordinarily sensitive to inertial forces and are used to measure accelerations and rotations with unprecedented accuracy. They are already used for precision mapping of the Earth’s gravitational field to provide information about what is under the surface. The novel features of the superfluid circuits we design could lead to new techniques for quantum sensing, such as gravitational sensors that can perform fast contactless weighing of e.g. large trucks and trains, contributing to transportation efficiency and logistics.\n\nIn May 2023 the Australian government launched the National Quantum Strategy, forecasting the sector could be worth $6 billion annually and employ 19,400 people by 2045. This project will contribute towards the two Strategy themes of developing a skilled quantum workforce, and building a trusted, ethical, and inclusive quantum ecosystem.",

A novel Bayesian framework for specifying hydrological models when no streamflow measurements exist is proposed. The framework uses a new likelihood function that operates with inferred, scaleless measurements of streamflow, enabling use of satellite reflectance and altimetry as surrogates of streamflow, while incorporating hydrologic signatures to introduce scale. A new temporal differencing-based reflectance surrogate overcomes deficiencies in existing alternatives, the framework enabling semi-distributed estimation for high order catchments. Streamflow data from Australian Hydrologic Reference Stations are to be used to assess the viability of the proposed framework, before application to ungauged catchments in remote settings worldwide.",

While some facets of such a crisis may be beyond our control, its potential impact can be mitigated through proper modelling, prediction and communication. This research addresses a key factor impeding hydrologic modelling, prediction and communication, seeking to utilize the power of hydrologic modelling under uncertainty along with derived or indirect streamflows to measure and model river flow worldwide. Success in this research will lead to a many-fold increase in hydrologic measuring capability worldwide, as fewer than 1% of catchments are presently gauged. Additionally, the new modelling paradigm developed for this new data source will create predictability where streamflow measurements are difficult to obtain. With the methodological concepts vetted over the past years through controlled experimental studies, and coarse scale remotely sensed measurements shown to demonstrate improvements across Australian catchments, this research has the potential to impact especially the poor and vulnerable worldwide, especially those in rural and remote settings that are difficult to monitor or protect.",

Don’s work was focused on fundamental biology of cytokines, which has led others to research side-effects of chemotherapy and combat viral infection in animals.\n \nThis project asks the big unresolved question of how cytokines can induce so many different activities on a cell by binding to a single receptor type. Can we engineer cytokines to produce just one type of signal that would be beneficial in the treatment of animal and human diseases without the side-effects? In the longer term it has potential to impact the Australian economy, through the development of engineered cytokines. The resultant intellectual property offers impact beyond academia, with the translation and adoption of novel applications, leading to spin-off companies and licensing deals.

This project addresses these concerns by tackling the significant research gap in developing fair learning algorithms that robustly handle diverse and complex performance measures in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, criminal justice, and the credit industry. The research innovates in creating efficient optimisation algorithms with theoretical guarantees capable of managing massive streaming data.\n\nDevelopments from this project will bolster Australia's competitiveness in fostering a future where algorithmic fairness pervades various sectors, thus mitigating the disproportionate impacts of AI systems on decision-making processes. The software generated will be available under an open-source license, while scholarly articles will be disseminated in conferences and journals. Patenting will be explored, offering potential for commercialisation and licensing opportunities.

Glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel, lacks effective conversion methods. Through innovating new catalysts and a continuous flow reaction system, the project aims to surmount this challenge, enhancing industrial feasibility. It addresses the biofuel sector's imperative for sustainable waste management, easing glycerol disposal and fostering economic opportunities. Additionally, co-producing hydrogen diminishes reliance on fossil fuels and environmental impact. Crucially, it aligns with Australia's strategic interests, potentially boosting the economy through hydrogen export. This project advances sustainability and economic development goals, offering transformative benefits to industry and the environment. Through regulatory support and knowledge dissemination, adoption of this breakthrough technology can substantially contribute to The Australian Government's Net Zero Plan, steering Australia toward an efficient, productive, high-wage economy and positioning it as a renewable energy superpower.",

Thus  Australia should be at the forefront of providing its people and businesses with remote online access to request use of resources which are managed in a decentralized fashion. These resources would range across natural ones such as water, energy, finances, and information.  This project will  prevent hackers from reordering requests for unfair benefit. The problem already arises frequently in the context of deregulated financial services, where malicious users reorder other user trades to benefit themselves. This is commonly referred to front running attacks, back running attacks or sandwich attacks, which benefit hackers to hundreds of millions of US dollars every year in blockchain environments. This project will offer new approaches using cryptographic techniques so that the ordering of requests that cannot be altered by malicious activities. Hence such a solution will ensure Australian citizens can have access to resources in a fair way, regardless of cyber attacks.",

While vaccines may be considered the holy grail for preventing viral infection, they come with inherent limitations such as adverse side effects, incomplete protection and need for annual boosters. The most effective antiviral solution is a protective system that prevents viruses from entering the human body in the first place either from contaminated surfaces or through the air.  This project aims to meet this need by developing a surface coating that destroys any virus upon contact. Using a water-based formulation, the proposed antiviral coating is environmentally friendly, non-toxic and cost-effective and can be easily applied to surfaces and impregnated in face masks to stop airborne transmission.  Beyond the obvious health benefits of protecting society from viral pathogens, the project expects to also deliver economic benefits by reducing annual costs associated with an incapacitated workforce and the burden on public health systems. Additionally, antiviral coatings are considered Mission Critical Technology by space agencies to prevent serious crew illness and interplanetary contamination from opportunistic microbes. If this antiviral coating is successfully developed, two multinational industry partners are ready to translate our research into commercial products through development, manufacturing, and global supply, delivering further economic benefits to Australia in the future.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Industrial colourants are commonly chemical dyes and pigments that fade with time and involve toxic raw materials and waste products. Nature offers an alternative: colour produced by nanostructures that self-assemble from simple building blocks due to their molecular properties. Mimicking nature’s self-assembled nanostructures can provide a low-cost, low-energy alternative to chemical colourants or structurally coloured materials manufactured using expensive nanofabrication techniques. However, our ability to draw on nature’s designs – optimised by millions of years of evolution – is limited by our ignorance of how complex nanostructures form during biological development. This project’s multidisciplinary team, spanning biology, materials chemistry and physics, aims to unlock nature’s secret to producing vivid colours using extraordinarily efficient processes, and develop bioinspired analogues using abundant, biodegradable polymers such as cellulose.  Sustainably produced, structurally coloured materials have diverse applications of commercial benefit to Australia including security features, packaging, labelling, and sensors. The advanced fabrication process will significantly benefit Australian industry by opening possibilities to efficiently manufacture materials and devices using greener technologies, reducing Australia’s impact on the environment.",

Inheritance after sex results in offspring getting half their genes from the mother and half from the father, but two parts of cells—the mitochondria responsible for energy conversion, and the plastids responsible for photosynthesis—do not follow this pattern.  Rather, mitochondria and plastids, including the genes therein, are typically inherited from just one parent, usually the mother.  We will investigate the molecular machinery that results in maternal inheritance of mitochondria and plastids in a unicellular microbe.  We will identify genes preventing microbial fathers from contributing mitochondria or plastids to their offspring.",

Related parasites infect our companion animals.  For instance, Australia has 6.4 million dogs, and the annual spend on a veterinary package to keep our best friend parasite free is $450.  Parasite control relies heavily on antiparasite drugs that target select genes.  Inheritance of these genes is poorly understood, which hinders our ability to control the spread of resistance if these genes become resistant to our drugs.  Our project aims to tease out the mechanism of gene inheritance in a model parasitic microbe, dissecting how such non-standard inheritance works, which will inform resistance management strategies. \n\nIt is important to understand how only the mother can pass on this cohort of genes as they are the targets of drugs that we use to control parasites of livestock & humans. The benefit of this research is to address the gap in drug resistance management and better understand the control mechanisms. \n\n",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australia’s marine environment is experiencing global change more rapidly than most places on earth, and our native marine fauna must adapt to these new conditions. Copepods (small marine crustaceans) play an essential role in marine food webs and the carbon cycle. By consuming and excreting phytoplankton (microscopic marine plants), copepods export a major proportion of the world’s atmospheric carbon to the seafloor. Copepods also underpin marine food webs to support fisheries and healthy marine ecosystems. But despite their ecological importance, we know surprisingly little about how copepods will adapt to global change. This project will address this knowledge gap by evolving an Australian copepod to future temperatures and phytoplankton availabilities to explore how climate change will alter their abundance and role in marine ecosystems. By focusing on an Australian native species, this project will provide direct benefits for the Australian marine environment and commercial marine economy. This project will deliver a novel framework that will allow a more robust and accurate accounting of Australia’s marine carbon sequestration potential under future climates, and will provide information essential for futureproofing Australia’s $3.6 billion fisheries industry. We will communicate our findings directly to stakeholders via our links with marine industry partners and government agencies to inform policy regarding sustainable fisheries and net carbon targets.",

    "summary": "Electrochemical Control of Fluorophore for Single-Molecule Light Microscopy. This project aims to show how fluorescence microscopy can be improved by modulating the properties of fluorophores electrochemically. This is significant as electrochemistry has already been shown to improve single molecule microscopy with better imaging and ability to detect individual molecules. This advance will make us towards single molecule counting which then opens the door to developing sensors with detection limits of a single molecule and that do not require calibration. The outcomes will be an understanding on the chemistry that allows electrochemistry to improve fluorescence microscopy, the commercialisation of new microscopes and new sensing technologies. These tools should provide new ways of understanding our molecular world.",

Excitation of fluorophores using light is the basis of fluorescence microscopy but this has limitations with regards to seeing multiple colours and being able to count single molecules. The proposed research will overcome these limitations by using electrochemical manipulation of fluorescent molecules in conjunction with light to give multicolour, single molecule counting light microscopes. Based on our recent discovery, this topic has never previously been explored. It will not only give better performing microscopes but also facilitate the next generation of single molecule sensors for quantitative analysis. The Australian owned intellectual property will give Australia a foothold in this expanding scientific instrument market and strength our enviable position in sensing. The new knowledge will show how electrochemistry can be used to optimise the properties of fluorophores for different microscopy applications as well as guide the synthesis of new fluorophores with advantageous properties for the new microscopy technologies.\nDrawing on our commercialisation experience, this technology will be targeted towards commercialisation with some interest already shown from the proof-of-concept work. The research questions answered in the proposed research are aimed at expediting the commercialisation opportunities this technology promises.",

The project aims to develop new materials and experimental tools to probe and exploit the complex ionic microenvironment at electrochemical interfaces – a centrepiece of clean energy and sustainable technologies. The novelty lies in using tuneable porous membranes made from electroconductive materials and charged polymers as a new platform to amplify and detect signals from the interfaces. Harnessing advanced characterisation and modelling, this project will build a key framework of the local ionic landscape and offer a new screening protocol for application-targeted ionic microenvironment design.

They are foundational to numerous sustainable technologies, such as batteries for energy storage, electrolysers for chemical and fuel production, fuel cells for electrical power generation, and water purification for clean water production. The efficiency of all these systems relies on the structure and movement of ions near these interfaces, which remain largely unknown. This project will develop new materials and tools to better understand the dynamic and complex ionic behaviour at these interfaces and use this new knowledge to improve electrochemical system designs and operations. The resulting new insights will be made broadly available through workshops, seminars, and media articles. The Australian industries adopting the project results will benefit commercially from the improved system and process efficiency and their reduced cost, accelerating the wide adoption of these clean and sustainable technologies. The increased use of these technologies will have profound environmental and social benefits to Australia through cleaner industrial processes and lower carbon emissions. Most importantly, this project will contribute to a cleaner future for Australia and assist in meeting our net-zero carbon emission targets by 2050.",

Late adolescence is the peak time for delayed sleep onset, sleep disturbances, exposure to evening light with light-emitting device use, fear regulation difficulties and the emergence of anxiety. This is the first study to examine how these sleep and circadian factors affect fear regulation responses and brain circuitry using novel ultra-highfield neuroimaging, and tracking naturalistic sleep and light exposure using wearable devices. The project will provide crucial new knowledge into the impact of sleep quality, delayed sleep timing and light exposure on fear regulation putting Australia on the cutting edge of sleep and developmental science. It will also help identify causal factors in the escalating crisis in youth wellbeing, which will lead to social and economic benefits, by enhancing productivity at school and work and reducing absenteeism. Results from this project will help us identify the specific sleep and circadian factors that lead to impaired emotional wellbeing in teenagers. This information will help us develop novel guidelines on recommended sleep and wake times, and amount of evening light exposure to promote optimal youth wellbeing. This information will be disseminated to parents, educators, clinicians and teens in workshops, online and social media forums, and school presentations.",

Thus, our organs are packed with different immune cells that fight off danger. However, not all immune cells are equal and can behave differently depending on the organ they live in. It is not well understood why immune cells in different tissues exhibit altered functions, therefore, using cutting-edge high-resolution technology, we plan to create an ‘atlas’ that maps the immune cell network in various organs. This will reveal cell and protein interactions with immune cells that will allow us to test how this network can support the tissue landscape.

Most immune responses start in our organs, not the blood. This is where invaders enter the body and cause harm. We know that immune cells in organs better protect us from infection than those in the blood. Within the tissue, they can quickly destroy these threats. However, the organ environment is complex. What allows our immune cells to best protect us in this terrain is unknown. Therefore, our project aims to create an ‘immune cell atlas’ of the body. Using the ‘cell map’ of each organ, we will explore how the tissue landscape supports effective immune protection. By understanding how immune cells work together, we will gain critical knowledge on different immune responses in different organs around the body. Our immune cell atlas will be free and accessible via an interactive web app, offering a novel educational tool that will attract the next-generation of scientists. The project will promote global collaborations, placing Australia in a competitive position to attract further investment towards understanding varied immune responses. This will result in substantial knowledge gain for industry and research sectors. We will communicate our findings to the community by publishing in high-impact journals, presenting at international conferences, and sharing our work with the public through social media, press releases, science-based radio and TV shows.",

Rising rates of mental illness impose enormous economic and human costs and heavy burdens on health services. Understanding what is driving this crisis is a matter of national urgency, but little is known about the cultural and social changes that contribute to it. This project will examine historical shifts in how the public thinks about mental health and illness, the sources of these changes, and their impact on people’s well-being. The research will clarify how concepts of mental illness have expanded their scope, so that they refer to an increasingly expansive range of experiences. It will reveal the changing cultural beliefs and values that underpin this expansion, and how broad concepts of mental illness can increase people’s vulnerability to mental ill health. Understanding these cultural and psychological dynamics can help us foster ways of thinking about mental health that boost rather than undermine resilience. The outcomes of this research will be actively shared in news articles and media appearances, capitalising on the researcher’s high national profile as a science communicator. The research will create a foundation for new ways of promoting mental health and preventing mental illness, with substantial social and economic benefits for Australians.",

    "summary": "Creating Safer Sport Communities from Rural to Urban Australia. Sport is intrinsic to Australian culture, particularly in rural and regional communities. However, sport cultures can also perpetuate gender inequalities and violence. This project aims to examine and address gender-based violence across Australian sports communities. The project expects to develop an in-depth understanding of the gendered nature of violence in this context and how communities can address such violence. Using an interdisciplinary approach, mixed methods and collaborative co-design, the project’s expected outcomes include a new evidence base, enhanced international interdisciplinary collaborations, and practice guides to improve the capacity and response of sport communities across Australia to address gender-based violence.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Gender-based violence results in significant harms for individuals and communities at great social and economic cost to Australia. As specifically identified in the Commonwealth of Australia 2022 National Plan, sport is considered a key setting for prevention work, given its importance in Australian culture. Yet, international research shows high rates of violence in sport, up to 76% across psychological, physical, and sexual violence. Little is known about the prevalence or experience of gender-based violence in Australian community sport nor how to address it. This project aims to address this knowledge gap and in so doing to reduce gender-based violence through creating safer sports spaces in Australia. To do this we will work closely with those who have experienced violence in community sport to develop practical tools and guides for identification and response and the means to apply them across diverse sports spaces. These will be shared through an online information hub and community of practice, as well as within our existing extensive networks, to build the capacity of sports organisations and their communities to reduce gender-based violence. In the current epidemic of violence against women, addressing sport’s gendered culture and practices will reduce the risk of gender-based violence for the benefit of all Australians.",

By leveraging the merits of the two most prevalent construction materials, the developed vessel will provide the excellent performance and durability under extreme conditions of MS storage (high temperature and corrosion). Expected outcomes include advancing knowledge in the behaviours of steel-concrete composite under high temperature and corrosive environments, and developing a new generation of MS storage vessel that is highly scalable, efficient, and cost-effective. This should provide significant benefits to Australia in accelerating energy storage technologies and fostering the national and global renewable energy transition.",

Molten salt technology is a commercially used technology to store the heat collected by concentrated solar power. Molten salt-storage vessels are traditionally constructed of steel, which are prone to failures due to issues related to the vessel design and construction as well as its operation under high temperature cycles. Thus, Australia has an urgent need for safe, reliable, and cost-effective vessel design. This project will develop the next generation of molten salt-storage vessels using steel-concrete composite systems. We will use experimental data and computational models to determine system performance under molten salt environments and create technical guidelines. We will promote the results and guidelines through our extensive academic and industrial networks as well as public presentations. Translation of the research will be accelerated through demonstrations to relevant companies in the construction and energy sectors, leading to commercial and economic benefits. Finally, the next generation of molten salt-storage vessels for solar power will increase the reliability and utility of solar energy creating enormous environmental benefits for Australia. Importantly, it will help Australia reach our net-zero goals by 2050.",

Positioning coastal reclamations and seawalls in Asia-Australia as artefacts of the Anthropocene, the project aims to highlight their historical role in the expansion of human habitat into the sea, provoking debate on the sustainability of human coastal terraforming practices and assisting the heritage field to reassess the significance of historic coastal infrastructure in the context of the current climate crisis. Examining the threat that sea level rise poses to reclaimed land that, over time, has been integrated into the terrain of everyday life in Sydney, Hong Kong, and Japan, the project will better equip the Australian public to understand the background to this threat, thus laying groundwork for enhanced climate resilience.",

Rather than presenting coastal reclamations and seawalls as part of the heritage of human progress, it shows them to be artefacts of the Anthropocene, infrastructural objects that have contributed to today’s environmental crisis. The project will generate what we term an ‘Anthropocene optic’ for heritage practice that encourages society to ‘own’ the negative ramifications of industrial-era technology and infrastructure, not to instil guilt about the past but rather to aid development of sustainable strategies for coastal living in Australia going forward. This alternative heritage optic will, for example, better equip people to engage in debates on strategies to manage the impact of sea level rise on the sandstone heritage seawalls of Sydney Harbour and the foreshore parks they protect. By meeting and engaging closely with heritage managers and museums and disseminating research results more broadly, including on social media platforms, it will not only build planetary consciousness among Australians but also climate resilience. In so doing, it will enhance Australia’s reputation as a global leader in heritage.",

The uterine surface epithelium is normally a barrier to embryo adhesion and must remodel in a small time window within each estrous or menstrual cycle to lose its barrier function enabling embryo implantation. If the endometrium does not remodel to become receptive this leads to failure of implantation and no pregnancy is established.

There is a profound lack of knowledge on how and when the uterine epithelium becomes receptive, yet receptivity is crucial for establishing pregnancy of mammals. While research suggests that microRNAs in uterine epithelial cells are crucial for allowing embryos to implant, how this happens remains elusive. Our initial findings suggest microRNA-124 that remains elevated in the uterine lining during receptivity leads to failed pregnancy.\nThis project will investigate how microRNA-124 regulates uterine surface changes to allow embryos to implant in mammals including cows, sheep, and marsupials as well as some lizards. We have made a genetic mouse model where we can switch microRNA-124 on in the uterine lining at a time of choosing. We will use this model to determine whether microRNA-124 is critical for establishing pregnancy. Our findings have the potential to inform and enhance future agricultural practices and help regulate fertility in both livestock and native species. The insights gained may inform wildlife conservation and breeding programs, thus aiding in the preserving biodiversity.\nWe will engage stakeholders in veterinary medicine, biotechnology and agriculture to promote and translate our research outcomes.",

Key agricultural crops like legumes can become unproductive because their symbiotic microbes cannot tolerate high temperatures. These symbionts turn atmospheric nitrogen into plant-available forms, improving soil nutrients and health. Recent breakthroughs show that supplying legumes with silicon, which is usually deficient in Australian agricultural soils, stimulates such symbiotic plant microbes. This project investigates how application of silicon and plant symbionts may mitigate the adverse impacts of higher temperatures in peas, with cascading benefits to wheat in crop rotations. To achieve this, the project addresses a key knowledge gap of how silicon-symbiont synergies affect soil microbial communities and soil nutrients, offering a new mechanistic understanding of these processes. This would inform safe supplementation strategies to improve the productivity and resilience of Australian legume-cereal systems. This has the potential to generate economic, environmental, and societal benefits to Australia, including reducing synthetic nitrogen fertiliser applications and greenhouse gas emissions, while increasing carbon-capture, soil health and crop productivity. The project will involve key stakeholders, including broadacre farmers and agronomists, to promote research outcomes beyond academia using demonstration plots and farmer events. This provides a clear route to translation, use and adoption.",

This project offers a solution to not only overcome limitations of traditional catalysts but that can enhance metal-complex catalyst performance by leveraging the optical properties of plasmonic metal nanoparticles. Our approach will advance understanding of light-matter interactions and explore parameters of a versatile photocatalyst design to achieve high-turnover chemical synthesis with minimal catalyst waste.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Transition metal complexes have long been essential in producing fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural compounds due to their proficiency in bond formation and high selectivity under mild reaction conditions. This proposal introduces a novel method to harness the advantages of homogeneous transition metal complex catalysts by temporarily immobilizing them on solid supports without loss of activity, using light. The concept integrates homogeneous catalysts into fine chemical flow synthesis in a manner that overcomes the challenging difficulties of catalyst separation and reuse. By utilizing the unique optical properties of plasmonic nanomaterials, this project will efficiently use light to bind and energize catalysis reaction centres, to trigger important chemical transformations at low temperatures, consuming less energy.\n\nTo promote the research outcomes beyond academia, we will engage with industry partners through workshops, conferences, and high-profile publications relevant to industry. The research offers significant benefits as it promises substantial cost savings and increased efficiency in chemical manufacture. Environmentally, it promotes a cleaner process and reduces raw material waste. Commercially, the innovation is adaptable to synthesis of valuable chemical products, boosting industrial competitiveness and job creation by developing safer, less hazardous chemical processes, with economic and environmental benefits for Australia.\n",

This project aims to investigate the physiological basis for a previously observed difference in how tropical conifers and their angiosperm counterparts respond to elevated carbon dioxide. In addition, it aims to determine the relevance of the differential responsiveness under field conditions in north Queensland. This project expects to fundamentally advance understanding of how tropical trees will respond to steadily increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. The expected outcome is an enhanced capacity to predict which tropical tree species will increase their growth rates and which will not. This should provide significant benefits to the tropical forestry sector, and to conservation and effective management of Australian tropical forests.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has increased by 50% globally since the beginning of the industrial revolution, driven by human activity. While this has caused global warming and climate change, atmospheric carbon dioxide also provides the fuel for plant growth. Its rise has likely resulted in increased growth of tropical forest trees, but a framework for understanding which tree species respond most strongly in species-rich tropical forests does not exist. Preliminary observations suggest that tropical conifer trees native to north Queensland benefit more than their angiosperm counterparts. In this project, we will identify the underlying processes that allow some tropical tree species to increase their growth rates more than others in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, and we will develop a predictive framework that can be applied to tropical forests broadly.  Being able to better predict tree responses to the inexorable rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide will benefit the Australian forestry sector by guiding species selections for plantings; natural resource managers through better informed predictions of carbon accumulation in terrestrial biomass; conservation practitioners by providing insight into species interactions, including between trees and the unique Australian fauna that depend upon them; and policy makers by helping to guide Australia’s path to net zero emissions including through carbon capture by forested landscapes.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Whilst Australia has become a world leader in quantum computing through heavy investment, Australia's potential to be a world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) is as yet unmet, with the Kingston AI Group concluding that the \"development of sovereign AI is of critical importance to Australia's future security and prosperity\". Our project establishes a novel metaphysics of AI: a framework for understanding physical learning agents that will revolutionise design principles for machine intelligence. Our research is foundational, and our key innovation is to situate learning agents in physics rather than cognitive science: our team of philosophers and physicists investigate the physics of beings that act in the world, both robot and human, to establish how these agents learn about the world, codify this knowledge, and navigate their environment. We expect our project investigating cutting-edge quantum foundations, the philosophy of how human agents systematise their environment, and how robots learn about the world to underpin future breakthroughs in the next generation of physical intelligent machines, with the potential to unlock the enormous wealth creation capacity of AI and establish Australia as a world leader in this space. As AI systems become increasingly capable and autonomous, our novel metaphysics of AI will be essential for ensuring these transformative technologies responsibly and reliably serve our society, rather than pose existential risks.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Understanding how microbial communities are assembled and function is a fundamental question in ecology. Fluctuating and nutritionally imbalanced resource supplies are common features of many microbial ecosystems, yet few studies have considered their role in shaping microbial communities and their function. Our working hypothesis is that in soil and gut ecosystems these nutritional challenges are met by different means of storing carbon within cells, and these physiological adaptations scale up and affect community assembly and ecosystem processes.\nThe project will have applications in agricultural, and biomedical research because understanding how communities assemble and function is key to the scientific manipulation of gut and soil microbiomes. For example, within the last 10 years it has become evident that the gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in human disease, as well as production/companion animal health. Predicting how nutrition shapes soil microbial communities and their function has consequence for agricultural practices including fertilizer application and retention of nutrients within ecosystems.\nProject findings will be directly disseminated to scientific peers via peer-reviewed papers and conferences. Our project will be embedded within the Charles Perkins Centre which has at its core the goal of accelerating the translation of fundamental research to ease the burden of chronic diseases.  ",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Alcohol consumption remains a major societal problem, contributing to myriad health conditions and costing Australia $6.8 billion a year. Australian midlife women (45-64 years) consume more alcohol than ever – more than previous generations of midlife women and more than other age groups of women currently. Alcohol poses health risks unique to midlife women, including increased risk of breast cancer - 10% of breast cancers result from alcohol consumption and there is no ‘safe’ limit (every drink over the lifecourse further increases risk for breast cancer). There is a global gap in knowledge about socially and culturally appropriate interventions for reducing alcohol consumption in these heavy-drinking groups of midlife women.\n\nOur study will work out ways to support the following groups of midlife women to reduce their alcohol consumption (and their breast cancer risk): 1) women living in regional areas of Australia; 2) LGBTQ+ women; 3) women living in poverty; and 4) women working in the corporate sector.  All these groups of midlife women are known to drink at levels deemed risky and heavy. Our multi-disciplinary, international research team will use innovative methods and theory to co-design and test interventions with community and policy relevance. We will provide solutions to the intersecting community, socio-political and commercial factors that shape alcohol consumption for different groups of midlife women.",

Studied extensively in classical coding theory, perfect codes have a natural generalisation to the setting of Cayley graphs, where they correspond to interesting tilings of groups. This project aims to undertake an in-depth study of perfect codes in several important classes of Cayley graphs, with a focus on their existence, construction and connection with underlying groups. A series of foundational results essential to further development of this young area of research are expected, via techniques from algebraic graph theory, coding theory and group theory, thus substantially enriching the theory of perfect codes in a broad framework.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Over the past five years, legislation has increasingly required individuals to seek dispute resolution services before going to court. Online dispute resolution (ODR) systems offer numerous advantages over traditional mediation, including better accessibility, convenience, cost-effectiveness, and faster resolution. Despite their global prevalence, ODR systems are underutilized in Australia. This project will benefit the society in three significant ways. Firstly, the research addresses critical questions for the mediation industry by identifying the most effective ODR protocols. The outcomes can significantly reduce social, financial, and environmental costs, freeing valuable resources for other sectors. Secondly, the results will inform practical policy and institutional design, promoting better integration between law and economics—two of Australia’s key fields. Thirdly, the project offers significant educational and training benefits by supporting undergraduate and graduate student research, providing opportunities to engage with ODR developments. The findings will be disseminated through publications and meetings with practitioners, and an online platform featuring the project’s outcomes. By advancing ODR system effectiveness and utilization, this project will enhance the mediation industry and contribute to broader societal and economic benefits, supporting Australia’s national interests in fostering innovative, efficient, and accessible dispute resolution mechanisms.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Numerous electrochemical technologies, including energy storage, electrocatalysis, and water desalination, are based on electrified surfaces, where electrolytes are in contact with conductive solid materials. When these solids interface with electrolytes, they can form an electrical double layer (EDL) where the adsorbed ions balance solid surface charges. The EDL theory is the bedrock for designing electrochemical devices and systems in real applications. Its theoretical framework was developed in 1924, and recent advanced experiments and simulations have shown that the current EDL theory is too simple. This project will develop a new fundamental theory for the EDL at the electrified surface. It will establish new theoretical models to accelerate the design of next-generation ionic technologies. The results will be published in industry media and be commercialised to develop and design novel technologies and devices for Australia’s knowledge-based manufacturing. Once applied, this research will benefit many sectors through its use in Australian applications such as chemical or pharmaceutical production processes, water desalination, mineral extraction, and advanced technology for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Thus, these devices and real-world applications will provide many economic, commercial, environmental, and social benefits for Australia.",

Gene expression is tightly controlled by transcription factors and modulating gene expression is important in bioproduction and in human biology. However, we do not understand how transcription factors find their target genes in cells and how they interpret not only the DNA sequence but also the epigenetic landscape. Our preliminary data suggests that transcription factors bind epigenetic readers to use a combination of both the underlying DNA sequence and the epigenetic landscape to identify targets in cells. Using a combination of innovative molecular biology, cell biology and genomics approaches, in this project we seek to develop a better understanding of how transcription factors find their target genes in DNA. This will change our understanding of transcription factor biology and represents a type of braille by which transcription factors scrutinise chromosomes to find target genes. The collaborative efforts of our expert international team will enhance Australia’s research capacity in the area of biological sciences.

    "summary": "How cells perform error-free repair of damaged DNA? This project aims to understand how a molecular machine, called the dissolvasome, fixes tangled DNA to ensure error-free repair of damaged DNA by homologous recombination (HR), a critical process in all life forms. This will generate new knowledge about HR pathway by recreating the function of dissolvasome in a test\ntube and providing atomic snapshots of its individual steps using advanced imaging technology of cryo-electron microscopy. The expected outcome will be a ‘molecular movie’ of the fundamental process of DNA repair.\nThe project's outcomes would have significant implications, from regulating sexual reproduction and creating genetic diversity in agriculture to improving cutting-edge gene editing techniques.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Often double-stranded DNA breaks and becomes tangled. There is a complex molecular machine in cells that helps with this untangling. We understand how some parts of this machine work, but fixing DNA needs all the parts to work together. We are not sure exactly how they coordinate because this machine is large and can change shape which has made it impossible to study using previous technologies. In this project, we will use a revolutionary new imaging technology called cryo-electron microscopy to create atomic snapshots of this machine while it is at work. These snapshots will give us a fundamental understanding of how this machine functions dynamically and increase our knowledge of DNA repair, an indispensable process to sustain all life forms.\nThe direct visualisation of this machine will allow us to understand how this machine works and how each part contributes to its function. Catching this machine in action will generate new knowledge about DNA repair that could lead to commercial opportunities being exploited in the future including precise gene editing for enhanced agriculture productivity, better understanding of aging-related diseases and promoting healthy aging.\nWe will communicate to the general public through our department newsletter, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, and science events geared towards the general public, like National Science Week, where the University of Melbourne is a regular participant.",

Yet, the processes underlying emotional learning are not well understood and research on the topic is fragmented. The current basic research project will address this gap by generating new knowledge on the topic with the aim to develop a new integrated framework to understand emotional learning across the entire range of emotion, positive and negative. \nThe current work also has potential applied implications. Biases and prejudice negatively affect large sections of society and relapse after successful treatment for an anxiety disorder is common (and not unexpected from a basic science perspective). Emotional learning is a key ingredient in the development of biases and prejudice and in gold-standard exposure-based treatments of anxiety disorders. Our basic research has the potential to inform the design of more effective and longer lasting interventions to reduce biases and prejudice or prevent the return of fear after successful treatment. These developments will benefit the people of Australia and beyond. The involvement of national and international leaders in the field of experimental psychopathology will ensure that research translation will not be overlooked and that the outcomes of the current work are not only disseminated in scholarly journals but to practitioners, and, using Curtin radio and social media, the broader public.

Understanding sex differences in immune response is crucial across several sectors, including wildlife conservation, agriculture, and vaccine and therapy development. However, the genomic basis for sex disparities remains underexplored due to male bias and the common exclusion of sex chromosomes in animal studies. Using cutting-edge technologies, this project aims to bridge this gap by generating multi-species sex-specific gene regulatory atlases of immune cell development.\n\nThis research will enhance knowledge of the role of sex chromosomes in immune system function in diverse animals, from Australian marsupials and dairy cattle to humans. Research on marsupial immune system could aid conservation efforts by integrating identified immune gene markers into breeding programs to maintain genetic diversity and exclude vulnerable individuals. Through the collaboration with Agriculture Australia this project will incorporate sex chromosome-linked gene markers into dairy cattle selection programs, potentially reducing inflammatory issues like mastitis, which costs the industry over AUD 400 million annually.

    "summary": "Mapping the bio-cultural impact of Papuan migrations into Wallacea. This project aims to explore the movement of Papuan genes, culture, and languages into Wallacea in the past 15,000 years. Multidisciplinary evidence suggests that New Guinea has been a key bio-cultural progenitor for contemporary Wallacean societies, though the underlying historical movements and exchange mechanisms remain poorly understood. By generating and integrating complementary genetic, linguistic, and archaeological records from East Nusa Tenggara and West Papua, this project will illuminate the historical processes and peoples that have shaped modern Wallacean society. Expected outcomes include a comprehensive re-evaluation of New Guinea's role as a bio-cultural hub in one of the most diverse but understudied regions on the planet.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The Wallacean archipelago is a renowned hotspot for human linguistic and genetic diversity, testimony to a deep history spanning more than 50,000 years. Like their neighbours in Australia and New Guinea, the Indigenous peoples of Wallacea are thought to have remained isolated from outside groups, and each other, for more than 45,000 years until the introduction of new genes and languages by Austronesian seafarers some 3,500 years ago. However, this static view of Wallacean history has been challenged by converging interdisciplinary evidence that documents the transformation of Wallacean societies by the infusion of Papuan genes and culture from around 15,000 years ago, and emphasises the potential of interdisciplinary approaches in reconstructing this poorly understood historical period. In this project, our international team will explore the origins, timings, and impacts of the historical migration of Papuan peoples across Wallacea, by undertaking a coordinated research program to gather new genetic, archaeological, and linguistic records for key regions in eastern Wallacea and West Papua. By disseminating our results through high impact journals and multiple media outlets, our research will raise global awareness of the rich bio-cultural diversity in this under-appreciated part of the world and reaffirm Australia’s leadership in transformative and ethical interdisciplinary research into human history.",

This project aims to explore the history of dramatic human modification of a Pacific Island landscape over the past 3000 years and draws out the implications of these transformations for future generations in a changing global climate. Since initial settlement, the island of Efate in Vanuatu has been spectacularly altered by a series of socio-agrosystems, recently revealed by LiDAR aerial imagery. This transdisciplinary project will combine field and archival research by archaeologists, historians and linguists to map social and agricultural development across Efate, generating a deep-time perspective that will inform responses to contemporary challenges around population growth and food security in the Pacific.",

Food security and pressure on resources are going to be critical challenges for many of Australia’s Pacific Island neighbours, with anticipated changes in social, agricultural and economic development. This project focuses on the history of past strategies of adaptation on Efate Island, Vanuatu, where there is an exceptional record of high-density population and innovative changes in land use in response to changing environmental conditions. To better understand the way Efate Islanders have adapted to changing environments over thousands of years, this project introduces cutting edge remote-sensing technologies alongside new archival discoveries and traditional knowledge of land use practices. A team of archaeologists, historians and linguists will work together to show how different strategies for adaptation on Efate might point to an expanded range of possible futures for land use across the region. Understanding these past strategies will add to the toolkit of disaster risk reduction measures and plans for climate change adaptation. This toolkit will also inform policy makers developing strategies to address climate change and its social, agricultural and economic effects in Australia and the region.",

Travelling within cluttered landscapes to detect and find a specific goal that is often occluded is a challenge for both animals and machines. While we rely on the 86 billion neurons in our brain to carry out spatial tasks, a jumping spider, with a brain smaller than a pinhead and just a few million neurons has determined ways to accomplish this task. This project will determine how animals with mini-brains navigate to specific goals in complex 3D environments and identify the required brain circuitry to solve such spatial tasks. This project will (i) highlight the strength of evolutionary biology and neuroscience in Australia, (ii) build research capacity by training young scientists in advanced microscopy and engineering methods, and (iii) discover how animals with miniature brains solve spatial computation. The project clearly aligns with the National Research Priority – Advanced Manufacturing. This project has enormous potential to generate IP and patents bringing economic and commercial benefits to Australia’s technology industry. The project builds on substantial prior investments from the Australian Research Council that has led to the development of technologies and insights. This enables us to advance our knowledge of the common but overlooked phenomenon of spatial navigation in complex landscapes.",

For example, detecting potentially catastrophic bushfires in their early stages, and alerting emergency services. If fire services are deployed while a fire is small it can be extinguished. Automated computer vision detection systems can be deployed more pervasively than manual approaches. However, current suitable detection approaches do not accurately estimate their confidence in their decisions. In this project, we will undertake key research to create computer vision approaches that accurately estimate prediction uncertainty. These will be applied to key problems including bushfire detection. Detection errors can cause critical delays to deployment of fire services, either by failing to detect fires early, or giving frequent false alarms. Our research will enable accurate confidence estimation, allowing overall dispatch systems to mitigate false alarms. For example, by closely monitoring early fires that are uncertain, rather than ignoring them, or immediately alerting fire services. We will publicly release our code for detection, and evaluate our approaches through the ANU-Optus Bushfire Centre of Excellence on our network of Australian fire detection cameras. Additionally, we will work directly with our partners in fire services to directly improve fire detection in Australia.",

The project aims to improve understanding of the role of terrestrial nutrient delivery in driving productivity of a hitherto neglected fishery sector: small pelagics (sardines, scads and small mackerels) in the Western Pacific. The high productivity, resilience to fishing pressure, and superior nutritional value of these fish warrant greater attention as population and market pressures increase. We will generate data correlating nutrient dynamics and fishery production, together with ethnographic data on local fishery knowledge, to better understand the relationship between small pelagic fisheries and the catchments that deliver the nutrients they depend on.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Small pelagic fish (sardines, scads and small mackerels) are by far the most important species for marine fishery-based nutritional security among Australia’s densely populated Southeast Asian neighbours but receive remarkably little scientific attention. Even less is known about these fisheries in two of Australia’s most geostrategically important Western Pacific neighbours, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, where their potential nutritional significance is rapidly increasing with burgeoning population pressure and climate stress. Small pelagic fish have vastly higher nutritional value (higher Calcium, Iron, Zinc, Vitamin A and Vitamin B12) than most other exploited fish groups and are much more productive and resilient than most other fish species. Small pelagic fish are part of plankton-based food webs which depend fundamentally on nutrient delivery from either upwellings or terrestrial runoff. Despite their nutritional and economic importance there is surprisingly little scientific literature on small pelagic fisheries, particularly on the significance of terrestrial nutrient delivery for their productivity. Key benefits of our research for Australia are significant nutritional security improvements among our low-income Pacific and Asian neighbours (with multiple human development flow-on benefits including improved maternal and child health, and educational achievement), and enhanced understanding of a scientifically neglected fishery sector at home.",

    "summary": "Unlocking the biodiverse recarbonising potential of Australian soils. This project aims to innovate the coupling of native plant diversity and carbon (C) sequestration to recarbonise degraded Australian soils. By combining an interdisciplinary experimental approach, modern analytical methods, and modelling, we expect to generate new knowledge about the effects of native plant diversity on soil C dynamics and stabilisation. Expected outcomes include identifying the biodiverse recarbonising potential of degraded Australian soils, improving soil and ecosystem health and functionality, climate adaptation, and resilience. Data generated from the project will show how native biodiversity and soil C sequestration offer a synergistic approach for conservation and nature-positive programs to benefit all Australians.",

For example, lightweight but high-strength metal components are vital in building aeroplanes. But so far only a few applications have been successful because the fabricated metal products vary widely in properties such as mechanical strength – a barrier that stops more industries adopting the technology. This research examines structures within the metal alloys called mesostructures, which play a critical role in their mechanical properties but have been overlooked until now. We will couple this new knowledge with machine learning and real-time monitoring during manufacture so robust metal alloys with specific properties can be produced consistently. Our research directly supports the Australian Government’s goal of upscaling advanced manufacturing and is a perfect match with their recently released blueprint – the Made in Australia Innovation Fund – by encouraging value-added local manufacturing and investment in key industries. Environmentally and socially, our findings pave the way for more energy-efficient manufacture of lightweight, consistently high-strength metal products, which benefits all Australians. We anticipate patenting our new monitoring approach, which will speed up industry uptake, for example, for online quality control for additive manufacturing of metal components. ",

Steel-making from recycling is still energy and carbon intensive. A much more sustainable approach is reuse, i.e., salvaged steel members from old buildings are repurposed directly in new constructions, thus eliminating the energy-intensive remelting process. Despite its great environmental benefit, reuse of structural steel is currently rare in Australia, mainly due to the lack of quantitative guidance for steel reuse in terms of safe design, service life prediction and reusability assessment. The fundamental experimental and reliability studies conducted in this project will produce new knowledge about the properties and structural behaviour of reused steel components, and to provide the industry with the scientific basis for safe design and management of structures consisting of reused steel members. Outcomes from the project will enable the Australian steel construction industry to explore the opportunities for reuse of steel to achieve considerable environmental and social benefits. This will thus contribute to the Australian Government’s national mission of emission reduction of 43% by 2030 and Net Zero emissions by 2050.",

This project yokes together the scores of novels, plays, short stories, poems, and genre fiction titles that have portrayed Darwin from Federation to the present. In so doing, it aims to pull Darwin from the literary void it has sat in for much of the twentieth century and restore it to the national imaginary. We will work with AustLit and AusStage to offer a series of public lectures and exhibitions at the NT Library, guided literary tours of Darwin, and a monograph that organises the literary texts into a series of accessible themed chapters for future educators, students and researchers. Other benefits include increased cultural visibility for north Australian writers and increased capacity for cultural tourism to the regions.",

People who grow up in the major southern capitals do so studying novels and plays about their home cities at school, or having versions of their lived experience and landscapes mirrored back to them in plays, genre fiction novels, popular literature, films and television series. People who have grown up in the northern capital do so in a relative representational void. This project aims to boost cultural, economic and educational activity in the NT and beyond by: offering the NT Tourism industry a series of guided literary tours and digital 'cultural maps' of Darwin; offering the general public a series of themed exhibitions at the NT Library and public lectures at CDU; offering major arts festivals (NT Writers Festival, Festival of Darwin) and book clubs access to forgotten writers and texts of national standing to rediscover and celebrate; offering educators a  symposium and monograph to introduce their students to the novels, plays, short stories and screen adaptions about Darwin in a series of easy-to-follow themed chapters; and offering lovers of literature and cultural tourists the nation over fresh ways and means to encounter the northern capital. In future, this research will not only offer a permanent literary record for an overlooked capital city, but add to a wave of post-pandemic cultural and economic activity that is revitalising the nation's regional centres.",

    "summary": "It’s about time: critical minerals in carbonatite systems. Meeting global demand for critical minerals requires identifying fertile rock bodies, but this is hampered by not knowing the exact timing and processes of their formation. This project aims to close this gap by investigating Laacher See as one of the world's youngest carbonatites. Through accessory mineral uranium series dating and geochemical-microtextural analysis, it can be revealed at unprecedented precision when and how critical minerals including the rare earth elements are enriched during carbonatite evolution. Applying this knowledge to past episodes of carbonatite formation within Australia's crust improves assessing their resource potential. Detrital accessory mineral properties can then be better used to trace hidden resources.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project aims to explore the resource potential of carbonatites, a rare type of magmatic rock often associated with economically significant deposits of critical minerals, notably rare earth elements. Rare earth elements are in increasing demand as crucial components in electric motors and generators, and are thus vital for Australia's net zero emission transformation. Discovering new carbonatite-hosted deposits within Australia’s continental crust is essential for securing future supplies. Understanding how and where these deposits form requires precise knowledge of the age of carbonatite magmatism. This project will employ innovative approaches in geochemistry and geochronology to investigate carbonatite minerals at the micro- to nanoscale. Through this, the timing and origin of carbonatite magmatism and associated mineralisations can be determined with unmatched accuracy and precision. Advancing knowledge on carbonatite magmatism is important for resource companies to devise new exploration strategies for hidden rare earth element deposits. These advancements hold particular economic and environmental significance for Australia, given its substantial mineral resources, leading mining technology sector, and commitment to green and renewable energy sources. Findings will be shared with industry stakeholders through conferences and internships with mining companies, facilitated by the Resources Technology and Critical Minerals Trailblazer programme at Curtin University.

It will collect data about people, ecosystems, infrastructure, and governance across >20 protected areas in Western Australia.

The analysis and modelling will address important gaps in our knowledge of how feedbacks between people and protected areas arise, are managed, and can influence the sustainability of conservation efforts. It will also guide decisions about what should be monitored to understand and respond to change in protected areas. The research will benefit Australians by providing a deeper understanding of the social and economic issues that influence biodiversity conservation, and by mobilising this knowledge for improved management and resilience of protected areas (that in turn provide numerous benefits to Australians). Our four-pronged communication plan promotes knowledge sharing with academics, practitioners and implementers, policy makers, and the general public respectively through targeted communications. The engagement of managers and traditional owners throughout the process will facilitate learning and knowledge transfer direct to the most relevant groups and stakeholders.

Australia has a long-standing reputation for excellence in astronomy research, and we aim to see Australia recognised as a world centre for excellence in stellar astrophysics. This will strengthen Australia's leadership in research using space telescopes, including possible future partnerships with the growing Australian space industry.\n\nThe project will benefit Australians by training students in the use of data from the world’s premier astronomical facility, providing them with analytical and computational skills that have wide applicability. The innovative project will also establish Australia's reputation as a world-leading user of JWST data, bolstering international collaborations with world-leading institutions working with space-based data.\n\nThe launch of JWST has sparked an incredible public interest in astrophysics in Australia and around the world. Through the large visibility of JWST in the media, the project will attract young Australians to take up careers in science and technology. Results from this project will be promoted to the public via extensive resources available via the media offices of NASA and the University of Sydney.\n",

This project will examine how escape responses to predators evolve through natural selection, a critical question in the conservation and management of threatened species. We will examine whether protection measures select for increased tolerance to threats, thereby making populations more vulnerable to predation. Using field studies of two threatened Australian birds, we will generate behavioural, genetic and demographic data to identify how management regimes influence escape responses, whether these responses are heritable, and how these responses affect survival. The project will be beneficial by enabling conservation groups to make evidence-based choices about management of protected threatened species.",

To prevent future extinctions of our native animals, we need to understand how human and other threats affect their behaviour and survival, and assess their ability to adapt to those threats. This project will examine the evolution of predator escape behaviour, a vital element of survival in the wild, in two iconic threatened bird species: the hooded plover and the helmeted honeyeater. The project will assess how escape behaviour varies in response to environmental threats, and how conservation measures affect this behaviour and ultimately the survival of the birds. The findings will fill a knowledge gap about the potential long-term evolutionary consequences of environmental disturbance and management on Australian fauna. The research will generate important information on behaviours that affect the survival of threatened species, and thus provide environmental and social benefits associated with preventing future extinctions. By working with government and non-government organisations, such as Zoos Victoria and BirdLife Australia, the project results will be communicated to land managers to inform future conservation measures.",

This is because stars produce the light and chemical elements necessary for planets to form and for life to exist. However, we also know that ionising, ultra-violet (UV) radiation is harmful to humans and can cause skin cancer. It is therefore critical to develop simulation techniques that can accurately model the propagation of UV radiation in gaseous media, such as the Earth's atmosphere. The development of such a code is a key goal of this project. Furthermore, the Australian Academy of Science's Decadal Plan for Astronomy stresses the need for infrastructure and research workforce investment to power Australia's leadership in international space research. The Plan identifies areas where Australia can make its greatest 'world-leading contributions', such as the origin of stars. Here we will make the most detailed predictions of star formation, advancing Australian-led research into gas/fluid dynamics, radiation, and chemistry. Through application of this fundamental research to chemical modelling, high-performance computing and plasma physics, the project will support industry to adopt new methods in areas of radiation transport in defence to pollution tracking in our air and oceans. These applications will benefit Australians in areas of national security, health, and environmental conservation, and Australia through global leadership in international astronomical discovery.\n\n",

Such timeframes inhibit supply, and are evidence that government and industry lack the necessary systems and tools to efficiently respond to the demands of urban growth. This project responds, providing a critical evaluation of the opportunities Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents as a support tool for DAs. State planning agencies across Australia are currently positioning AI as a necessary tool to accelerate DAs, but this eager technology adoption is risky without critical urban research and theorisation. This project uses case studies, interviews and thought experimentation with key stakeholders across the urban planning and land development sectors to investigate critical legal, technical and ethical questions central to industry adoption and public acceptance of AI-informed DAs. The outcome is a new ‘Trustworthy AIDA’ conceptual framework, better preparing Australia’s planning and development sector to tackle the challenge of future rapid urban growth.

This project aims to develop more efficient and safer solid-state lithium battery (SSLB) alternatives, which represent the optimal solution for next-generation energy storage. However, incongruity between various components within SSLBs lead to large battery resistance and rapid capacity decay, challenging their practical application. This project will tackle these issues at various levels via synergistic approaches ranging from atomic structure engineering to surface regulation, materials design and manufacturing. The research will generate new interdisciplinary knowledge, advance the frontiers of energy storage, and revolutionise current battery technologies. The expected outcomes will enable more powerful and safer energy storage systems for electric vehicles and sustainable smart grids, which could help combat climate change and position Australia as a global leader in the critical transition to a decarbonised economy. Project breakthroughs will lead to patents, open new business opportunities for industries, and contribute to Australia’s leading position in energy storage field. Our broader outreach strategy will encompass professional seminars for researchers and stakeholders, high school STEM studies promotion, and an active media presence to expand the influence of this exciting research beyond academia.",

It underpins the chemical industry, one Australia’s largest manufacturing sectors, contributing around $40 billion to GDP. It is a key enabler of food and agriculture, advanced manufacturing, medical technologies and pharmaceuticals, and mining. Chemical synthesis is possible because we know a little about how to bring atoms together to form molecules. The problem is that we don’t know how to do this well. Chemical synthesis of virtually any stable molecule is feasible but is neither practical nor sustainable. This project aims to invent innovative new approaches to make chemical synthesis both practical and sustainable. It aims to develop groundbreaking new fundamental science to make molecules faster and cleaner. It also aims to use plant-derived and sustainably sourced building blocks in place of non-renewable precursors. The academic outputs of this work will lead to new industrial collaborations with potential applications ranging from medicines to advanced materials. Significant outcomes and benefits of this work include enhanced capacity in cutting-edge chemical synthesis, and hence accelerated invention of new pharmaceuticals and other important materials. This project will also benefit Australia by training people in the experimental skills needed by future high technology industries.",

The knowledge advance from this project will directly inform challenges faced by industry partners (e.g., Horticulture Australia) and government (e.g., CSIRO, DPI). Revealing how visual signals are optimally detected has the potential to improve the design of visual guides such as traffic signage across land, air and sea, pedestrian management and hazard alerting. It will also generate new and important insights for emerging technologies across robotics, autonomous sensors and self-navigating vehicles.

    "summary": "Demystifying employee disclosure of retirement plans at work. This project aims to improve and streamline the retirement transition process by investigating employees’ disclosure of retirement plans (DRP) at work. DRP is an important step in retirement transition with considerable benefit for both employees (obtain much needed support and accommodation on pathway to retirement) and employers (enables succession planning); but DRP is a fraught issue for employees who are wary of discrimination and lost opportunities. The project will generate vital knowledge aimed at improving retirement transition practices in the workplace. This knowledge will provide significant benefits to employees as well as employers on how to achieve wellbeing and productivity outcomes for Australia’s ageing workforce.",

In order to transition to a proactive approach, critical new knowledge is required to determine best practice approaches that involve robust and productive late-career employee-organisation relationships. This project will provide strategies and tools to enhance this transition. The research will determine a stronger grasp of how to effectively prepare and support both employees and employers by identifying major factors that disrupt the retirement process. Creating an online training program that focuses on preparing for retirement will contribute to new knowledge and resources that offer a more detailed initiative, based on the needs of Australian employees and employers. Additionally, the findings will be presented to the Australian Human Rights Commission, Council on the Ageing, public and private sector human resource professionals, and other relevant stakeholders. This project’s findings and recommendations will impact industry and government organisations and deliver immediate social, economic, and commercial benefits. ",

Yet working collaboratively with such systems is challenging, if not impossible at present, as systems are unable to effectively coordinate with human co-workers. Our research will enable human-AI teaming by developing approaches that allow human and AI team members to better understand each other’s actions. Our research will allow AI agents to understand and anticipate human actions based on a combination of long-term observations and patterns, an awareness of the current situation, and will allow humans to refine AI teammate actions through direct feedback, building trust and enhancing teamwork. Furthermore, our research will explicitly capture uncertainty in decision making, allowing AI agents to make decisions in complex and rapidly varying conditions, including in settings where sensors of communications fail. This research has broad applications across the service, manufacturing, transport, mining, and defence industries, and will become increasingly important as robots and AI agents become more common place. To promote the research, we will create two demonstration systems that showcase the outcomes in transport and drone contexts, and the research team will work with existing industry connections across government, aviation, defence, and mining sectors to realise the full potential of this ground-breaking research.",

This experiment will inform the design of heavier spin-mechanical devices, approaching the mass where gravity may induce \"quantum collapse\".

Despite their success, these two physical theories are fundamentally incompatible. They are expected to clash for objects near the Planck mass (20 micrograms). No experiment has ever jointly tested quantum and gravity at that scale, because massive objects lose their quantumness as they get heavier, while gravity forces vanish as they get lighter.\nThis Project will take on this challenge, by combining an unquestionably quantum object (an atomic nucleus) with a massive one (a mechanical oscillator). The experiments will unveil how the behaviour of the nucleus is affected by the motion of the oscillator, and inform the design of a scaled-up device where the gravity pull on the oscillator may “collapse” the quantum dynamics of the nucleus. Such experiment would constitute a historic landmark in humanity’s understanding of the physical world.\nShort-term, the Project will develop powerful methods to detect mechanical motion, with applications in detecting minuscule forces. Long-term, it will inform efficient ways to resolve one of the biggest questions left open in modern science. All along, it will keep Australia at the forefront of quantum and gravity research, two fields where it operates at the international state of the art.",

Using C. elegans as a tractable model system, combined with state-of-the-art microscopy and sophisticated genome engineering approaches, the project aims to advance our knowledge of how these fragile cells resist the forces imparted on them during development and body movement. Outcomes include a mechanistic understanding of how tissues co-operate to withstand physical strain, the molecules involved and how force is buffered by the nervous system.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "For any animal, its survival depends on an ability to detect and respond to surrounding stimuli, such as food and predators. Once detected, these stimuli are relayed to the brain where a response is formed and sent to muscles to trigger a behaviour. This communication occurs via electrical signals that travel through long cable-like structures protruding from neurons called axons. Axons span large distances, reaching up to 1 metre in humans and 30 metres in some species of whale. How these structures can resist the many forces imparted on them during normal growth and body movement to remain intact and sustain life across decades is not currently known.\n\nThis project aims to shed light on the biological mechanisms that keep axons intact to discover new knowledge that will be critical for a range of fields, including developmental and cell biology, neuroscience, engineering, and materials science. Understanding the biological consequences of mechanical force also has the long-term potential to impact industries such aerospace and defence, where the impact of force on the human body is a major consideration in the design of new technologies. Also, without knowledge of how a healthy system functions, changes that occur in diseased states can neither be recognised nor corrected. The fundamental cellular mechanisms discovered here will therefore be essential to guide future studies aimed at understanding neurological disorders and diseases that involve axon health.\n",

This may sound like a purely philosophical question. However, the observer is at the heart of standard quantum theory – one of the pillars of modern physics. It is a theory about what observers may observe, not a theory about what exists in the world independent of the observer. The researchers in this project will build on their prominent recent work to perform novel quantum experiments. These will test whether various candidate systems act as observers, given certain common assumptions such as the ability to freely choose experimental settings. The results will either lead to the discovery of completely new physics or, given those assumptions, rule out some classes of observers.\n\nSome of the proposed experiments will push the development of photonic technology in Australia in new directions. Others will use quantum computing technology, a growing industry in Australia ripe for future partnerships. The project will train future leaders in the Australian quantum industry or academia. It will advance pure knowledge relating deep themes of free will, reality, and whether an Artificial Intelligence can be an observer. These are topics of broad interest to Australian society. We will disseminate our findings through public talks, interviews, and writing for popular science magazines and books. All of this contributes to the success of the National Quantum Strategy.",

    "summary": "Wave Propagation and Attenuation in Unsaturated Soils. Understanding shear and dilatational waves in unsaturated soils is critical for diverse engineering disciplines. While past research has focused on wave propagation in saturated or dry soils, studies on unsaturated soils are scarce, despite their common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This research aims to bridge this gap by investigating the fundamentals of wave propagation in unsaturated soils through a multidisciplinary approach encompassing soil dynamics, constitutive modeling, and experimental investigation. The expected outcome includes development of accurate correlations for characterisation of soil properties for a range of in situ conditions, offering immediate practical applications in engineering design and practice.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This research focuses on how waves move through unsaturated soils, which are soils that are not completely dry or fully saturated with water. While most past studies have concentrated on either wet or dry soils, unsaturated soils are the most common in real-life situations. Gaining a better understanding of these soils is crucial for various engineering fields.\n\nThe research will explore the dynamics of wave propagation through natural soils at a fundamental level by carefully examining soil behaviour under controlled laboratory conditions as well as through computer simulations. This deeper understanding will lead to many practical improvements. For instance, it will help locate and extract natural resources more efficiently, and it will enhance subsurface mapping techniques, allowing the creation of more accurate maps of what lies beneath the ground. Additionally, the findings will improve non-destructive testing methods, enabling us to assess the safety and integrity of structures without causing any damage. Furthermore, this research will contribute to better seismic hazard investigations, helping us understand and prepare for earthquakes more effectively.\n\nIn summary, this study will significantly enhance practices involving the movement of waves through soils, resulting in safer and more efficient infrastructure. The benefits will extend across multiple industries, ultimately helping to protect people and enhance the prosperity of the nation.",

It’s a leap forward in medical technology and non-destructive testing, which are crucial for maintaining high standards in manufacturing and healthcare.\nThe gap this project fills is significant: currently, there’s no real-time way to get a 3D view of an object’s internal structure without physically dissecting it or using time-consuming methods or ionization radiation. By addressing this, the project aligns with the Australian Government’s national innovation agenda, promoting the country’s skills in creating new technologies.\nFor Australians, the benefits are manifold. Economically, it means better quality control in manufacturing, leading to less waste, and higher profitability. Socially, it offers educational opportunities for students with skills in a high-demand field. Environmentally, improved efficiency translates to reduced resource use. Commercially, the technology can be licensed, creating new businesses or enhancing existing ones. Culturally, it cements Australia’s reputation as a leader in global innovation. In essence, this project will not only enable seeing the unseen but will also secure a brighter, more efficient, and more innovative future for Australia.",

Neuronal self-fusion, that is, the merging of separate sections of an individual neuron, is a poorly understood biological process. Yet, self-fusion is known to occur in multiple animal species during the development, remodelling, and repair of the nervous system. This project aims to define how developmentally regulated self-fusion occurs in the nervous system, the molecules that mediate this process, and its importance for neuronal function. Expected outcomes include new knowledge on the process of neuronal self-fusion. These findings should provide significant benefits by offering novel insights into nervous system function, and thereby positioning Australia at the intellectual forefront of this innovative and fervent area of research.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Understanding how the nervous system develops, and how individual neurons acquire their specific shapes that are necessary for their function, are major unanswered question in biology.  One of the most remarkable events observed during development of specific neurons is fusion between parts of the same cell to achieve peculiar structures, such as toroids (i.e., doughnut shapes), in a process known as self-fusion.  This project aims to study how self-fusion occurs in the nervous system, the genes that regulate this fascinating process, and its importance for neuronal function in mediating an animal’s behaviour.  Importantly, these studies also have the potential to reveal how single-celled tubes and toroids are formed in other, non-neuronal tissues, which remain broad and open questions in biology.  These findings will represent a major leap forward and fill a significant gap in scientific knowledge.  Our country will directly benefit as the nation where these discoveries are made, and by having the opportunity to initiate applications that might arise from these findings.  In addition to the biotech industry, these studies might also indirectly benefit the biomedical field by providing the new knowledge needed to develop strategies to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders and to repair neuronal damage.  To advance our research outcomes beyond academia, we will engage with UniQuest, the commercialisation company of The University of Queensland.",

Our research will provide vital information to increase the activity of materials that use energy from light to breakdown PFAS. The project will: 1) produce new materials which absorb light and use the energy to breakdown PFAS, 2) optimise the process, and 3) ensure PFAS is broken down into non-toxic by-products.\nThe researchers will communicate outcomes to their peers via conference presentations, to the public through social-media, web-posts and outreach events, and to industry through conferences, workshops and direct communication. \nFindings could be translated by environmental remediation industries to treat soil and water contaminated by PFAS both within Australia and worldwide.  Knowledge in the interaction of PFAS with materials can be applied to other remediation strategies. Widespread implementation of this technology would reduce exposure to PFAS in the environment, leading to a decrease in the associated adverse effects on human and ecological health.\n",

The rate of sea-level rise in coming decades depends heavily on how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet changes. This project aims to tightly define the uncertain ice-bed physics that will govern that rate of change. The project is based on recent observations of rapid, climatologically forced changes in the glacier elevation, and focuses on near-instant responses to climate-varying melt of downstream ice shelves. Existing models of ice-shelf/ice-stream dynamics will be perturbed by climatological changes in ice-shelf melt and the modelled perturbations in upstream strain and elevation compared with observations. This will allow us to better predict the speed at which the ice sheet will change due to changes in ocean driven-melting.",

Future coastal sea levels will depend to a large extent on how quickly Antarctic glaciers will flow into the ocean. The project will develop a new method to calibrate Antarctic glacier models which are used to project future sea levels. This calibration will be based on newly observed changes in glacier thickness and speed that show fluctuations over decades. The project will enable improved sea-level projections, with the results fed into the Australian ice-sheet modelling groups that inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sea-level projections. The new knowledge will be translated to Australia's ACCESS climate model which is currently being developed to add ice-sheet model capability.  The project will bring new knowledge to Australia through collaboration with two leading US and UK-based scientists and, by training three early career researchers, develop much-needed increased capacity and capability in Australian glaciology and sea-level science.

    "summary": "A new \"Treating Customers Fairly\" law for Australia's financial industry. The project aims to investigate the Treating Customers Fairly regime law (put forward by an Australian Law Reform Commission (Commission) Inquiry into reforming our financial sector legislation), by utilising, for the first time, an internationally comparative critique of existing Treating Customers Fairly regimes in the UK, South Africa and New Zealand. This project will generate new knowledge: a blueprint for adoption into Australia of such a regime, in line with the Commission’s suggested government policy direction. The outcomes include significantly enhanced consumer protection and effective law enforcement. Benefits include a much simplified, more effective law, governing every consumer, and every financial product in Australia.",

It will analyse the successes and failures of the adoption of the same model into the United Kingdom, South Africa and New Zealand. It will address the gap identified by the Banking Royal Commission, namely that our current legislation is not fit for purpose and should be replaced with a model in which norms of behaviour are enforced, instead of relying on narrow, technical prescriptive provisions giving rise to tokenistic responses. Our hypothesis is that this model will more effectively address misconduct and consumer harm, as it is arguably the leading model, internationally, for driving good conduct and preventing consumer harm in the financial industry. This project has significant potential to restore trust in our financial industry and prevent misconduct. No other industry affects as many consumers, and to such a great degree. As such the potential for impact for the community and the broader economy from this project is unparalleled. We will promote our findings to members of Parliament, regulators, policymakers, journalists, to the Attorney-General's department and Treasury and to government inquiries as we did with pilot research to the Australian Law Reform Commission which, as a result, recommended a regulatory architecture that would accommodate a TCF model.",

With First Nations rangers, this project will create a large-scale database of dingo words including from different speech styles and song through detailed case studies. This database will be the basis of a model of language change that better reflects dynamic historical relationships between Indigenous groups.

However, deep uncertainty in sea level projections is compromising effective adaptation and mitigation, not only in Australia but globally. The largest source of uncertainty in ice sheet models is a crude or missing representation of fractures that produce icebergs and may lead to instability. This project addresses this problem using observations together with a novel hybrid model to develop an innovative method for the prediction ice shelf stability.

These mitigation efforts require accurate and reliable climate information, however projection of sea level rise is very uncertain. This lack of clarity comes notably from Antarctica where future ice losses are extremely uncertain because models disagree. One of the largest sources of uncertainty in ice sheet models is a crude or missing representation of icebergs delivered into the ocean from floating ice shelves. Current ice sheet models rarely capture icebergs, nor the vertical ice cliff at the end of the ice shelves that produce them. This project is an interdisciplinary programme of research designed to address iceberg calving and ice shelf stability as a critical knowledge gap causing high uncertainty in sea level projections. The national and global benefits are highlighted by the latest assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6), which states that global mean sea level rise of 2 m by 2100 or 5 m by 2150 cannot be ruled out due poorly understood feedbacks associated with iceberg calving and stability of calving ice cliffs. Accurate understanding of such high-impact events is needed for Australian policymakers, coastal adaptation practitioners and stakeholders concerned about climate risk.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "The increasing global population and climate change are major threats to global food security. This project addresses current and future global food shortages by improving crop productivity and food quality. Currently, crop improvement relies on traditional plant breeding and genetic modification (GM) where foreign DNA is integrated into the crop.  Both approaches have introduced many valuable traits into crops but they are extremely time-consuming and expensive. For example, a new GM crop variety is estimated to take 12-15 years and >US$130 million to commercialise. Furthermore, the acceptance of GM crops by the public is faltering, with a transition to non-GM agriculture gaining considerable traction globally, particularly in many of Australia’s important export markets. Gene editing is a new technology with the potential to fine tune important plant genes to increase crop yield and food quality, but currently involves the integration of foreign DNA into outdated crop varieties. In contrast, our novel gene editing approach aims to use RNA to fine tune plant genes in current crop varieties in a non-GM approach, thereby allowing the rapid development and commercialisation of new crop varieties into the future. If successful, this project will bring economic, social and health benefits to Australia through higher crop productivity and global food security, improved food quality, and expanded export markets.",

This project aims to address the knowledge gaps about the role of inorganic carbon in soil carbon turnover and its impact on climate-change mitigation. The significance of this research lies in the fact that inorganic carbon accounts for over 30% of soil carbon but is little studied despite it is affected by climate change and land-use practices. The expected outcomes include the development of a soil carbon turnover model that integrates inorganic carbon processes and the mapping of soil inorganic carbon stock changes due to climate change and irrigation across Australia. The benefits of this research will be improved understanding and management of soil carbon stocks, contributing to more effective climate-change mitigation strategies.",

Soil carbon can help Australian agriculture achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, while simultaneously increasing the export value of the industry. \nHowever, while the focus has addressed organic carbon over the past decades, the way organic and inorganic carbon in combination affect soil’s carbon storage is not fully understood. Inorganic carbon, which makes up more than 30%, is impacted by climate change and land-use practices such as irrigation and fertilization, and its link to organic carbon is poorly understood and quantified. Here we propose to generalise a soil carbon turnover model to incorporate inorganic carbon processes in order to model soil inorganic carbon stock changes due to climate change (warming and drying) and map hotspots is dissolution of inorganic carbon due to irrigation in drying and drought-prone areas across Australia. This improved understanding will facilitate management and policy design, including in the economic strategies supporting governmental agencies and private trading of carbon credit units (ACCU), with the estimated volume of 110 million units valued more than 4 billion Australian dollars.",

    "summary": "Beyond virus sensing: Rig-like receptors in biomolecular condensates. The immune system has receptors to detect viruses that trigger an anti-viral response. The only known function of Rig-like receptors, such as Rig-I, is to detect RNA viruses. However, our studies reveal a unique role for Rig-I in the formation of biomolecular condensates. Biomolecular condensates, rich with proteins and RNA, are liquid droplets, not unlike oil droplets in water. Within the spatial confines of a cell, these droplets provide dynamic compartments that control important cellular processes. In this proposal, we define the novel role of Rig-I in the formation of biomolecular condensates and determine how this impacts cellular function. ",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project aims to elucidate the long-term implications of cellular stress, generating new knowledge into subcellular organisation. Biomolecular condensates are subcellular compartments that form inside plant and animal cells as a response to environmental stress, which includes immune stimuli, pathogens, toxins, temperature changes and oxidative stress. We anticipate that the project’s findings will provide a new approach with new targets for modulating cellular function in the face of environmental impacts. Potential outcomes from understanding the roles that biomolecular condensates play in cellular function, as well as the rules that govern their formation, include providing better options for Australia’s response to the impacts of environmental change on biological systems. The new knowledge generated in this proposal has the potential to inform a range of sectors that are key to supporting Australia’s economy including health, food and the environment. In addition, the outcomes may provide benefits to future application in Australia's growing biotechnology sector that is vital to the nation's well-being. By ensuring that the project uses state-of-the-art technology, provides public access to generated datasets, and the results are shared in public and Industry focused forums, the projects outcomes will reach beyond academia to maximise future adoption and translation.",

Transmission of solar-generated electricity to Southeast Asia via undersea cable is part of this vision. The potential for such an initiative to deliver environmental, economic and social benefits for Australia and the region is significant. Yet fraught and fragile global conditions overshadow the realisation of this energy interconnection plan. The project addresses this volatile background by analysing how transborder renewable electricity infrastructures transform geopolitics. It investigates the Sun Cable proposal for renewable energy export from the Northern Territory to Singapore in relation to similar infrastructural undertakings in the Mediterranean and Northeast Asia. The research will benefit Australia by assuring that policy making to support the energy transition at the regional level is informed by international developments. Rather than treating the energy transition and geopolitics as separate concerns, the project highlights their mutual implication and fosters forward-thinking policy debate to enrich national perspectives on the geopolitics of energy. Findings and insights will be shared through regional stakeholder forums, a national summit on regulatory vulnerabilities and digital methods resulting in non-traditional research outputs accessible to wide audiences. Collaboration with parliamentary librarians will facilitate integrating new knowledge produced by the research into relevant briefings.",

Aims: This project aims to establish a scientific framework that exploits single-component e-fuels/powerfuels to formulate blends that atomize into optimal sprays for clean and efficient combustion. This will be demonstrated using novel, hybrid flash-air-assisted atomizers, and canonical burners. Advanced laser diagnostic methods will be employed to measure the spray quality and flame structure. Significance: The generated e-fuel blends will power future carbon-neutral energy conversion systems. Expected outcomes include predictive methods to tune the selection of e-fuel blends based on novel data sets. Benefits: This new approach will inform and guide Australia’s transition from fossil-based fuels to optimal blends of carbon-neutral fuels.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "E-fuels, also termed “green” because they are generated from renewable sources, are integral to the global transition towards net-zero-carbon. Liquid e-fuels offer attractive advantages over gaseous alternatives such as hydrogen or ammonia because they are common single-component liquids that do not have compatibility issues and can be easily transported using existing networks, infrastructure, and shipping methods. This project addresses the fundamental scientific challenges which remain unsolved yet critical towards the exploitation of single-component liquid e-fuels to enable novel blends that can optimize the processes of atomization and combustion. This will be achieved by resolving two outstanding research gaps: (i) efficient break-up of liquid e-fuel blends, and (ii) stable turbulent combustion of these sprays with minimal formation of pollutants. The resulting e-fuel blends will not only benefit a cleaner global environment but have the potential to yield economic gain to Australia through novel e-fuel manufacturing industries. This project will train the next generation of scientists who will position Australia as a leading power in the deployment of green e-fuels and facilitate its drive towards decarbonization. The project will leverage existing links with industry to communicate the advances to the mining, manufacturing, and transport sectors, to encourage uptake, and to exploit a unique opportunity to develop more efficient production methods for liquid e-fuels.",

Using the case study of Kangaroo Island (KI, South Australia), this project aims to develop actionable landscape management recommendations to mitigate fire risk while conserving rare taxa. Our research will reconstruct accurate, island-scale histories of vegetation cover, climate, and fire incidence to provide new knowledge on the natural recurrence, cause and impact of regional-scale fire events. We will also develop and validate next-generation genetic and geochemical proxies for past vegetation and fire regimes, benefitting global research efforts to develop an improved understanding of climate, fire and ecosystem dynamics. Through consultation with the SA Government, the research will benefit regional and national agencies by developing risk management strategies and guiding landscape management and conservation of threatened ecosystems. In doing so, the research will benefit tourism, agriculture and economic activity in the region. Our findings will be promoted through SeaLink, a new KI Visitor Centre, and 2 public fora on the island; and more broadly through traditional and social media.",

Using fresh scholarly and creative approaches, this project aims to examine the hidden histories of the Western Pacific’s Anglo and German plantations. We will examine indenture, blackbirding (kidnapping) and forms of unfreedom, with a focus on gender and mixed-race relationships. Linking archives in English and German, and foregrounding Pacific voices, especially of women, we will generate new knowledge of plantation lives, the labour trade and its legacies. Working with museums and Pacific artists we will also meet urgent demands for public redress and commemoration.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Heightened geopolitical tensions in the Pacific have led to an urgent renewal and reset of Australia’s links to the sea of islands surrounding us. Nevertheless, many Australians know little about Pacific history and culture. This is despite significant diasporic communities in our midst, some of whom trace their origins to Australian plantations. This lack of public understanding stems partly from the fact that histories of global slavery and unfree labour have, until recently, been overwhelmingly Atlantic in focus. This project addresses these major, interlinked gaps in history and public engagement. It has two key aims. The first is to create new knowledge about the lives of Western Pacific plantation workers through multilingual archives and three important ethnographic collections of Australia, Germany, and Fiji. We will also answer recent calls to deepen Australia’s social and cultural connections to our Pacific neighbours by collaboratively and respectfully giving voice to their perspectives on the world. This will be aided by engaging with contemporary Pacific and Australian South Sea Islander writers and artists to reimagine legacies of the Western Pacific’s plantation system, thus enabling our project to pioneer new and creative practices of memorialisation and truth telling. Translation and dissemination of findings to wider audiences will be through compelling stories (including an online Story Repository), educational content for schools, and public exhibitions.",

Many teens use sexts to consensually explore emerging sexual citizenship. Yet this is prohibited, and teens-who-sext may experience gender-linked sexual shaming and victimisation, including by adults. This cultural studies project gathers teens' perspectives upon and remedies for peer-perpetrated and peer-magnified image-based sexual harassment and abuse. Reports of sextortion, sexualised deepfakes and blackmail of teens by adult predators are rising, even as teens worry that reporting such abuse might see them, as victim, accused of creating child exploitation material.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Our project investigates teenagers’ opinions and activities around sexting, recommending improved responses that minimise harm. Unlike Australian adults, teens can face severe legal consequences for consensual sharing of sexual images. As well as legal implications, teens risk shaming, blackmail, school expulsion and psycho-emotional distress. ‘Don’t sext’ is not working: 87% of 14-18-year-old Australian school students say they receive sexts; 70% send them. We will also respond to newer threats to teens’ intimate communications - sextortion and AI-facilitated deepfake porn - collecting an evidence base for legal change and filling the evidence gap created by a reluctance to take seriously the fact that teens sext. Our UK co-investigator will share novel research methods underpinning emerging British strategies to teach teens respectful, consensual approaches to sexting. Economically, we aim to reduce direct and indirect emotional, health and legal costs to teens and families affected by the failure of current sexting policy settings. Social and cultural benefits include supporting an engaged conversation with and about teens as emerging digital and sexual citizens. We aim to impact public awareness and the law, better serving teens and sharing their views through policy submissions and media engagement. Connecting with policymakers and media, in addition to teens, will ensure our findings reach a wide audience, supporting the adoption of effective responses to teen sexting.",

As a brand-new class of materials, metamaterials exhibit a range of extraordinary physical properties through its elegant multiscale structures other than material constituents per se. As a more recent and highly potential branch, mechanical metamaterials achieve exceptional mechanical properties via motion, deformation, and stress-strain response through their well-designed architectures. The initial efforts have largely focused on metamaterials for negative mechanical properties in linear context, such as negative Poisson’s ratio, negative shear modulus, and negative thermal expansion coefficients. \n\nThis project will explore the nonlinear regime of deformation by developing new design optimisation algorithms for novel flexible metamaterials. The research will largely broaden the scopes and generate richer mechanical gain and a greater potential. The outcomes will enable a series of technological breakthroughs ranging from soft robotics, stretchable LIB battery, wearable medical sensors, arterial stents, cushion insoles, and soft implants to impact mitigation. The research training will provide the postdoc researcher, PhD and Hons students with an excellent opportunity to work on an exciting research frontier.

    "summary": "Osteoclast recycling by asymmetric partitioning of damaged mitochondria . In vertebrate animals, osteoclasts constantly resorb & remodel bone during homeostasis in response mechanical and hormonal factors that signal via the chemical RANKL. Osteoclasts are giant multinucleated cells formed by the fusion of macrophages. But they also fission into osteomorphs during RANKL-stimulated bone resorption. Very little is known about this new cell and cellular process since it was discovered in 2021. This project aims to test the idea that accumulated metabolic stress during bone resorption triggers cell fission. It will generate new knowledge about the mechanism & biology underlying this new cell type. It will enhance interdisciplinary collaboration & build Australia’s research capacity & thought leadership in the field.",

However, very little is known about osteoclasts and how they cope with the cellular stress of breaking down bone. Knowing this is critical because the ability to remodel bone is essential to ensure the growth and survival of all vertebrate animals. The proposed research will seek to bridge critical knowledge gaps about the life cycle of osteoclasts and how a new cell we discovered called osteomorphs are able to extend the lifespan of osteoclasts by ‘regenerating’ their mitochondria. The findings from this research will benefit multiple disciplines of cell biology, such as immunology, bone, stem cell and developmental biology. It will develop new technologies and resources for tracking the fate of these cells that can be used by other disciplines of biology. The project will build Australia’s capacity in state-of-the-art R&D technologies including intravital imaging and single cell genomic capabilities and cement our position as international leaders in these fields.",

The innovative combination of methods including cellular and molecular neurobiology, stem-cell technologies, genetics and bioinformatics, supercomputer-enabled analyses and mathematical modelling (including machine learning) will benefit many other areas of complex biology research, and create new advanced training opportunities to benefit several critical sectors. These new capabilities may expand the scope and scalability of strategic industries, including biotechnology, brain-machine science, information processing, and artificial intelligence. \n\nFurthermore, improving breeding of dunnarts in captivity may benefit conservation of native fauna, which is particularly important as Australia has the highest rate of mammalian extinctions globally. Expanding knowledge about dunnart genetics, development, and behaviour in laboratory conditions will help to refine husbandry of threatened species, such as the Sandhill dunnart, Kangaroo Island dunnart, and many other endangered small marsupials, where habitat preservation alone may not be as feasible, or effective, as selective breeding with genetic monitoring.",

Synthetic biology is yielding novel tools that allow the modification of RNA in cells, to alter traits in agricultural, environmental and medically-relevant backgrounds.

We will uncover how pentatricopeptide repeat sequence-specific RNA editing and nuclease proteins are able to structurally couple binding to the correct RNA sequence with enzyme activity. These mechanisms prevent off-target effects. We will then design and test protein fusions with other editing and nuclease proteins, and will build regulated, safe-to-use, versions of these proteins, testing their activity both in vitro and in planta, ready for use in agrobiotech.",

Cells have molecular systems which can modify the RNA instructions, and we seek to develop ways to control such modifications using biotechnology. A key issue is how cells ensure that modifications happen only in the correct message. This project aims to understand how cells use ensure only the correct information is altered, and to adapt that knowledge to develop further biotechnological tools that controlling gene expression. This can be used, for example, in the production of hybrid crops or in the production of high-value products such as drugs or vaccines.

Alternative spaces for social connection and community support in remote parts of Australia can be limited, and libraries can therefore provide much needed assistance for many relatively disadvantaged families and individuals by offering access to physical and online collections, running regular events, and facilitating digital inclusion. No research focused on the impact of public libraries on Australian rural communities has been published this century, and evaluation of the extent to which library services and rural community needs align is long overdue. This project investigates if, and how, rural libraries are meeting the needs of the populations they serve, and how they might better support their communities in a changing environment, by examining the role of the library from the perspectives of community members, including both users and non-users. Research outcomes will be shared at a national roundtable with industry stakeholders and at the national conference of the Australian Library and Information Association, with key implications and recommendations published in a white paper.",

The project will provide an important platform for future projects that monitor LHI’s other fauna and flora, to protect against invasive species, and prevent the extinction of endemics. The project will contribute to several goals of the Lord Howe Biodiversity Management Plan, including Objectives 14 (To improve knowledge and management of threatened and significant fauna species) and 14.1.1 (Conduct species-specific fauna research based on identified research priorities into the ecology of priority species, particularly with regards to reproductive ecology and habitat requirements) and Corporate Plan Item 4.4 (Improve awareness and understanding of the environment through education and research. Action 2: Encourage appropriate environmental research which is of benefit to LHI environment and community). Lord Howe Island's spectacular geography and significant number of endemic species led to it being added to the World Heritage List in 1982.

Yet the evolution of oceanic dissolved oxygen, when complex cells evolved and links to major critical metal deposits are poorly known—largely because existing studies are from rocks formed in the same Baltic-like sea 1.5 billion years ago (as revealed by new plate-tectonic reconstructions). We will address this by studying ancient rocks that formed in different oceans (rocks now in WA & India).

Oxygen also controls the solubility and mobility of many critical metals needed for a sustainable energy transition. Despite this, the history of how Earth’s oceans and atmosphere became so rich in oxygen is poorly known, hindering our understanding of the evolution of life and the controls on where to find critical metals. This project uses new billion-year scale models of deep-time plate-tectonic geography of the planet coupled with new ways to date ancient sedimentary rocks and track dissolved oxygen levels, pioneered by the investigators, to map the evolution of oxygen in our atmosphere and hydrosphere.  This project will place Australian research in the forefront of global efforts to understand how earth systems evolved in deep-time leading to cultural benefit (greater understanding of how the Earth works), training of researchers, and economic benefits through understanding the controls on ancient ocean chemistry that can help target prospective rocks for critical metal discovery.  This new knowledge will also provide advanced solutions to benefit industry by mapping times and places in Australia to target critical metal discovery and exploration. For industry and government stakeholders, results will be translated and widely dispersed through industry networks, trade and popular publications, and freely available software.",

Our vast ocean estate positions us as a potential global leader in marine-based carbon removal, given the limits of large-scale terrestrial drawdown. This potential cannot be realised without an effective legal framework that facilitates marine carbon removal, protects unique marine environments, and safeguards Indigenous rights and other marine uses. \nThrough policy briefs and events for government and industry, social media and podcasts, this project will provide evidence-based advice on law reform, based on principles of adaptive, integrated marine management. A robust legal regime can unlock the economic potential of Australia’s marine carbon removal markets, estimated at AUD30+ billion per year. It will promote sustainable private investment, innovation and employment in marine science, engineering and secondary industries, while respecting other marine uses and priorities, restoring marine ecosystems, mitigating ocean acidification and preserving biodiversity. A model law disseminated to international stakeholders through online workshops and international conferences will enhance Australia’s contribution to and reputation in climate diplomacy, and promote global governance of marine carbon removal. \n\n",

This project aims to explore the technological variability of Homo sapiens in their expansion out of Africa to Australia over the last 200,000 years. The project expects to generate new knowledge in the areas of archaeology and human origins by employing groundbreaking 3D computational analysis of stone tools found in sites spanning the period of Homo sapiens expansion. Expected outcomes of this project are to understand the technological underpinning of our forebears' successful expansion out of Africa, their replacement of other hominin species, and the pace and routes of expansion. This should provide significant benefits in understanding human evolution and the resilience of our species in the face of major climate change.",

    "national_interest_test_statement": "Australia plays a pivotal role in understanding the human spread of our species out of Africa and into Australia by 65,000 years ago. Australia presents the end point in the great arc of dispersal from Africa, through Eurasia, culminating in ocean voyages to cross island Southeast Asia and reach the Australian mainland. Archaeology, genetics and fossil human remains are beginning to flesh out this story, but a fundamental component of the record remains largely untapped - stone tools. This project employs Australian scientific expertise to map the changes in stone technology used by humans as they migrated out of Africa. Australian science leads the way in characterising and analysing stone tool technology using bespoke sophisticated three-dimensional analytical applications and detailed experimental studies of efficiency, complexity and cognition developed at the University of Queensland. This approach allows characterisation of how tools were made, how the technology was passed down between generations and transformed as people spread out of Africa, helping map cultural ancestor-descendent relations and chart human migration and responses to climate change - an issue of great relevance to society today. This project showcases Australian scientific expertise in documenting the technological underpinning of modern humanity's first epic journey and the peopling of the world.",

At home (thinking for family), it is disproportionately shouldered by women. At work (thinking for colleagues), our data show the same pattern. In parallel, women are underrepresented in leadership positions, with little sign of closing this gap. We connect these problems, suggesting the mental load stunts the emergence of female leaders, especially if they take on high load at home and work, or if the load is unfairly shared with their male partner/colleagues.

    "national_interest_test_statement": "This project connects two problems—the “mental load” and leadership gender gaps—to offer scientifically-informed solutions to closing this gap via equitable distribution of the mental load at home and work. The mental load is thinking work required to achieve goals for others (at home or work) and is usually shouldered by women. It is topical in the press, with belief that it stunts women’s careers. But research is inconclusive—we do not know when or why the mental load helps vs hinders leadership progression. Gender equality is an Australian strategic priority and a United Nations Sustainable Development Goal. But reports show that these goals are not being met. Gender Equity Insights (WGEA, 2023) and Women in the Workplace (McKinsey & Company, 2023) reports highlight the underrepresentation of women in management and its detrimental impact on the leadership pipeline and business performance. Currently considered factors that contribute to leadership gender gaps are not sufficient to explain or address it. The mental load, as the thinking work in relation to communal goals done mostly by women, has direct relevance to leadership gender gaps. Connecting these problems therefore promises not just to advance knowledge of the mental load and leadership gender gaps; but our field-interventions and stakeholder engagement promise scientifically-informed policy change and interventions aimed at increasing gender equity in the mental load and closing the leadership gender gap.",

Despite a comprehensive understanding of the roles different cell types play within the immune system, the mechanisms controlling their development and how they move through the body to target infection are poorly understood.  This is largely due to the complexity of studying these cells within their natural environment inside the body. Using advanced animal modelling and molecular techniques, this project will pioneer a new platform to track immune cells throughout their lifecycle, from early-stage cell growth to end-stage immune function. The dramatically enhanced insights into immune cell networks made possible by this new platform could pave the way for future development of treatments for both animal and human disease. This will benefit wildlife conservation efforts and public health, crucial for preserving both Australia's unique ecosystems and the well-being of its population. Further, the platform technology established in this project has the potential to be widely adopted across Australia and internationally. To ensure effective dissemination and translation of our findings beyond academic networks, we will collaborate with industry and policymakers to facilitate expanded investigation of all facets of immune cell biology, and position Australia globally at the forefront of science and technology.",

Biofouling on ship hulls not only brings extra costs through fuel penalty ($10 billion per year globally), but also ecosystem damage through migration of invasive species. Traditional antifouling coating predominantly involves toxic nonspecific biocides, harming marine biodiversity. This project develops sustainable antifouling products through cutting-edge nanotechnology and biomimicry research. Outcomes will help advance the skill levels of current manufacturing industries, ensuring they remain competitive. Addressing biofouling will bring economic benefits to maritime industries, and environmental benefits to all Australians through reduced bio-contamination and protection of ecology. Findings on biomimicry solution to biofouling will be communicated to coating industries, maritime research organisations, advanced manufacturing research organisations, and government bodies to promote understanding of the novel technique and further collaboration for translation and adoption. Technologies developed through the project can contribute new manufacturing opportunities, enabling future growth in the marine, aviation, piping and renewables industries.",

It will develop these technologies ‘at home’ in Australia to boost commercial gain by domestic chemical manufacturers who can add value to our natural resources. These new chemicals will speed up chemical reactions, resulting in faster development times of medicines and agricultural chemicals. Given Australia’s unique reserves of these strategic metals, our new technologies will support Australian chemical manufacturers to develop their commercial potential, and in turn enable home-grown industries to provide a lower-cost and local supply of key materials needed in our modern economy.",

However, there are many more hazards that Australians are exposed to on a day-to-day basis, particularly in industries with routine exposure to toxic chemicals (e.g. painting, fumigation, refrigeration, fuel filling and mining). Currently, there are few sensors that are widely available for determining chemical hazards in our surrounding environment.\n\nThis project aims to explore a new approach to chemical sensing by using poly-ionic liquids as new membrane materials in highly robust, miniaturised, leak-free sensor devices. The chemistry of the materials will be carefully designed to target chemical hazards that are present in the air and in water bodies such as polluted lakes and rivers. This project will offer government agencies, mining companies and industries the ability to detect hazardous substances in a simple, cost-effective, user-friendly method that can be used by non-scientists. The knowledge generated in this project can be used by our industry contacts to design rapid, portable, low-cost, miniaturised sensors to identify risks to both humans and the environment, and implement the necessary controls. The innovation will result in significant cost and operational-safety benefits to Australian and overseas industries where monitoring of exposure to toxic substances is critical.",
